Introduction\n\nOver  the  past  decade,  ceria  particles  have  attracted  signiﬁcant\nattention  due  to  their  physical  and  chemical  properties  which\nhave  proven  to  be  very  useful  especially  in  integrated  circuit  fab-\nrication  technology  such  as  chemical  mechanical  polishing  (CMP)\n[3–7].  Cerium  oxide  is  ambiguous,  containing  multiple  valences\nof  which  the  most  commonly  used  are:  cerium  (III)  oxide,  Ce2O3\nor  cerium  (IV)  oxide,  CeO2.  However,  the  most  prevalent  form  in\nwhich  cerium  oxide  exists  is  CeO2 [1],  which  enhances  chemical\naction  on  oxide  surfaces.  For  the  remainder  of  this  paper  we   will\nuse  cerium  oxide  and  ceria,  interchangeably,  to  refer  to  CeO2.\n\nCeO2 possesses  a  ﬂuorite  structure  with  a  lattice  constant  of\n0.541  nm  [1].  The  earliest  use  of  cerium  oxide  was  as  a  hydro-\ncarbon  catalyst  during  the  high  temperature  cleaning  process  of\nself-cleaning  ovens  [2].  Cerium  oxide  based  slurries  have  been  used\nfor  decades  in  glass  and  optical  lens  polishing  [3,4].  Recently,  ceria\nbased  slurries  have  emerged  as  important  abrasives  in  CMP   appli-\ncations  such  as  shallow  trench  isolation  (STI),  liquid  crystal  display\n(LCD)  and  interlayer  dielectrics  (ILD)  applications  [3–7].  STI  is  an\nisolation  technique  used  for  semiconductor  devices  with  small  line\nwidths  and  high  transistor  density  [5].  STI  embeds  ﬁeld  oxide  into\n\n∗\n\nCorresponding  author.

The  STI  pro-\ncess  starts  with  growing  pad  oxide  on  a  silicon  wafer,  followed\nby  deposition  of  a  nitride  layer,  lithography  and  patterning,  and\nthen  a  shallow  trench  is  etched  into  the  silicon  substrate  using  the\npatterned  nitride  layer  as  a  mask.  This  is  followed  by  liner  oxida-\ntion,  and  CVD  oxide  gap  ﬁll  [5].  The  last  steps  include  oxide  CMP\nto  remove  the  overburden  silicon  dioxide  (stopping  on  the  nitride)\nfollowed  by  nitride  strip  [5].  Ceria  abrasives  are  used  widely  in  STI\nCMP   slurries  due  to  their  high  selectivity  [4–7],  that  is,  the  oxide\nremoval  rate  is  high  while  the  nitride  removal  is  low.  Ceria  particles\nhave  the  ability  to  absorb  silicate  ions  in  the  removal  of  silica  dur-\ning  the  CMP   process.  Ceria  based  slurries  have  higher  polish  rates\nthan  silica  based  slurries  and,  at  the  same  time,  improved  surface\nﬁnish  [4,7].  Several  studies  have  been  done  to  investigate  the  mech-\nanism  of  both  the  high  selectivity  of  ceria  slurries  and  the  CMP   of\nsilica  surfaces  by  ceria  abrasives  [3–11,14]  yet  no  exact  polishing\nmechanism  is  known  for  CeO2.  Most  of  these  studies  were  based  on\nthe  adhesion/interaction  of  the  ceria  abrasive  with  the  silica  sub-\nstrate.  The  “chemical  tooth”  model  was   proposed  by  Cook  [8]  for\nglass  polishing,  which  is  said  to  be  responsible  for  the  high  oxide\nremoval.  In  this  model,  a  temporary  chemical  bond  initially  exists\nbetween  the  ceria  abrasives  and  the  silica  substrate  which  is  said\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f250 \n\nK.

(1)  below:\n\nCe  OH \n\n+\n\n  Si  O− ↔\n\n  Si  O  Ce \n\n+\n\n  OH−\n\n(1)\n\nHowever,  Cook’s  explanation \n\nthe  removal  of  silica \n[9], \n\nis  only  a  theoretical  expla-\nnation  of \nin \nthe  CMP   process.  Fur-\nthermore,  Osseo-Asare  et  al. \nin  their  study,  concluded\nthat  the  adsorption  phenomenon  is  responsible  for  the  mate-\nrial  removal  mechanism.  To  explain  the  nature  of  ceria/silica\ninteraction,  Abiade  et  al.  [4]  examined  the  effect  of  ceria  slurry\npH  on  silica  removal.  Using  atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM),\nX-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  and  scanning  electron\nmicroscopy  (SEM)  to  examine  particle–surface  interaction,  they\nshowed  that  the  removal  of  silica  is  strongly  dependent  on  the  pH\nof  the  ceria  slurry  with  the  maximum  removal  occurring  near  the\nisoelectric  point  of  the  slurry.\n\nDespite  the  many  advantages  of  using  ceria  slurry,  it  is  difﬁcult\nto  remove  ceria  particles  from  silica  surfaces  during  CMP   clean-\ning  steps.  CeO2 removal  from  the  SiO2 surface  is  critical  because\nremaining  particles  cause  defects  [10],  and  the  STI  process  occurs  at\na  very  sensitive  location  in  the  process,  that  is,  at  the  transistor  level.\nIn  the  CMP   process,  micro-scratches  are  one  of  the  main  problems\nin  the  planarization  of  SiO2 surfaces  that  is  caused  by  contaminants\nor  the  use  of  crushed  abrasives.  However,  the  nature  of  this  scratch\nformation  is  not  fully  understood.  Volkov  et  al.  [11],  in  their  study\nof  the  adhesion  of  ceria  abrasive  on  silica  surfaces  during  the  CMP\nprocess,  showed  a  correlation  between  adhesion  and  the  creation\nof  scratches,  speciﬁcally  higher  adhesion  correlates  with  a  higher\nnumber  of  defects.  They  went  on  to  propose  that  the  agglomeration\nof  abrasive  particles  also  causes  the  number  of  defects  to  increase.\nThe  interaction  between  CeO2 abrasives  and  SiO2 surface  can  be\nexplained  by  electrostatic  and  van  der  Waals  forces.  In  the  semi-\nconductor  industry,  defect  minimization  is  a  major  challenge  and\nalso  of  great  interest  especially  in  the  manufacture  of  sub  15  nm\ndevices.  From  the  literature  [10]  it  is  understood  that  defects  are\nformed  mainly  due  to  the  interaction  between  the  slurry  and  wafer\nsurface  during  the  CMP   process.  Therefore,  defects  can  be  reduced\nthrough  a  fundamental  understanding  of  the  slurry  particle–wafer\nsurface  interaction  to  enable  the  removal  of  the  particles.  Zhang\net  al.  [12]  suggested  that  the  slurry  composition  can  be  designed  in\nsuch  a  way  that  prevents  particles  from  depositing  onto  the  wafer\nsurface  during  the  CMP   process  and  that  a  repulsive  electrostatic\nforce  is  necessary  to  inhibit  particle-wafer  deposition.  This  can  be\nachieved  by  measuring  the  zeta  potential  between  the  abrasive  and\nthe  ﬁlm  surface  as  function  of  pH.  A  repulsive  electrostatic  force  can\nbe  reached  when  both  abrasive  and  wafer  surfaces  have  the  same\nsign.  Additives/chelating  agents  can  also  be  used  in  the  slurry  to\nmodify  its  pH/zeta  potential  and  also  will  minimize  particulate  con-\ntamination  arising  from  particle-wafer  interaction.  Zhang  et  al.  [12]\nstudied  the  effect  of  using  a  common  pH/chelating  agent,  citric  acid,\nto  control  alumina  particle  deposition  on  tungsten  and  oxide  sur-\nfaces.  They  found  that  the  use  of  citric  acid  can  minimize  alumina\ncontamination  signiﬁcantly  on  both  tungsten  and  oxide  surfaces.\nIt  has  also  been  stated  that  the  pH  of  the  solution  is  critical  to  the\nadhesion  and  removal  of  particles  from  surfaces  [10].  Furthermore,\nbased  on  a  study  of  Cu  CMP,  it  was  concluded  that  alkaline  slurry  is\nrequired  to  control  particulate  contamination.  However,  in  practice\nchanging  the  slurry  pH  can  be  detrimental  to  the  CMP   process.\n\nXPS  is  an  effective  technique  for  surface  analysis  and  has  been\nused  extensively  in  many  areas  of  surface  and  materials  analysis\ndue  to  the  exceptional  combination  of  compositional  and  chemical\ninformation  that  it  provides.  SEM,  along  with  Auger  emission  spec-\ntroscopy  (AES)  imaging  and  point  analysis,  were  applied  to  obtain\ninformation  about  wafer  surface  topography  and  composition  of\nthe  multi-elemental  sample,  at  various  pH  levels  (pH  6,  9,  and  12)\nchosen  based  on  the  results  of  the  zeta  potential  determination.\n\nThe  experimental  analysis  of  the  effect  of  pH  on  ceria–silica  inter-\naction  for  the  subsequent  removal  of  ceria  abrasives  from  silica\nsurfaces  will  be  useful  to  obtain  clean  silica  surfaces  and  to  design\nslurries  that  limit  contact  between  abrasive  and  substrate  during\nthe  CMP   process.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  there  are  no  other\nstudies  which  employ  these  surface  characterization  techniques\nto  understand  the  mechanism  of  residual  CeO2 contamination  and\nremoval.\n\n2.  Experimental  procedures\n\n2.1.  Ceria  slurry  preparation\n\nThe  ceria  slurry  used  in  this  study,  namely  CeO2,  from  Nyacol\nNano  Technologies,  had  a  20  wt%  ceria  concentration.  De-ionized\nwater  (Milli-Q  UV  PLUS),  referred  to  as  Milli-Q  water,  was\nused  for  slurry  dilution  to  5  wt%  concentration.  The  pH  of  solu-\ntions/suspensions  was   measured  by  an  Accumet  Basic  AB15  pH\nmetre,  which  was  calibrated  each  time  prior  to  use.  Citric  acid  and\npotassium  hydroxide  were  used  to  adjust  the  pH  of  suspensions.  A\nsilicon  oxide  wafer  which  was   cleaved  into  three  1  cm \n  1  cm  pieces\nwas  used  as  the  substrate  for  this  experiment.  The  substrate  was\ndipped  into  the  ceria  suspension  for  1  min   at  a  stirring  speed  of\n286  revolutions/min.  It  was  then  rinsed  in  Milli-Q  water  for  1  min\nat  a  ﬂow  rate  of  250  mL/min  and  dried  in  air.\n\n×\n\n2.2.  Zeta  potential  measurements\n\nIn  order  to  measure  the  surface  charge  of  the  particles  in  the\nslurry  and  on  the  wafer  surface,  the  zeta  potentials  of  ceria  and  sil-\nicon  dioxide  particles  were  measured  over  a  wide  pH  range  (3–12)\nusing  a  Nano  ZS  Zetasizer  from  Malvern  Inc.  The  suspensions  used\nwere  prepared  by  a  dilution  of  the  original  slurries  to  approxi-\nmately  1  wt%   for  ceria  and  0.5  wt%  for  silica  using  Milli-Q  water.\nThe  pH  of  the  suspensions  was  adjusted  using  citric  acid  and  potas-\nsium  hydroxide.  The  zeta  potential  measurement  recorded  was  an\naverage  of  three  consecutive  measurements  for  each  sample.  The\nrefractive  indices  used  were  1.457,  1.33  and  2.1  for  silica,  water  and\nceria,  respectively,  while  the  absorptivity  was  set  at  0.01  for  silica\nand  0.05  ceria.  All  measurements  were  done  at  room  temperature\n(25 ◦C).  The  viscosity  was   set  at  8.872 \n\n  10−4 Pa  s.\n\n×\n\n2.3.  Particle  size  distribution\n\nParticle  size  and  size  distribution  of  the  ceria  slurry  was  found\nusing  a  Malvern  Nano  ZS  Zetasizer,  which  was   previously  used  for\nthe  zeta  potential  measurements.  The  ceria  suspension  used  was\nprepared  by  dilution  of  the  original  slurry  to  0.5  wt%  using  Milli-Q\nwater  and  the  pH  was   adjusted  to  approximately  4 \n  0.03.  A  small\ndisposable  cuvette  was  used  to  hold  the  suspension.  All  measure-\nments  were  done  at  room  temperature,  25 ◦C.  The  refractive  index\nwas  set  at  2.1  and  1.33  for  ceria  and  water,  respectively.  Again,\nthe  ﬁnal  measurement  recorded  was  an  average  of  three  consec-\nutive  measurements.  The  average  particle  size  was   determined  to\n∼5  nm  at  pH  4  (Fig.  S1  in  supplementary  information),  and  is\nbe \nconsistent  with  the  particle  size  given  by  the  slurry  supplier.  At  pH\n4,  the  particles  were  mono-dispersed  and  therefore  show  little  or\nno  agglomeration.\n\n±\n\nSupplementary  Fig.  S1  related  to  this  article  can  be  found,  in  the\nonline  version,  at  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.03.170.\n\n2.4.  XPS  measurements\n\nAll  XPS  measurements  (except  pH  12  survey  spectrum  –\ndiscussed  below)  were  completed  using  a  Kratos  Axis  Ultra  spec-\ntrometer  equipped  with  a  monochromatic  Al  K(cid:2)\n  (hv  =  1486.7  eV)\n\n\fK.

The  sample  wafers\nhybrid  lens  and  a  spot  size  of  700 \nwere  secured  to  the  sample  bar  with  copper  strips  and  transferred\n∼10−9 Torr.

For  pH  12,  a  Mg   K(cid:2)\n  source\n(1253.7  eV  operated  at  120  W)   was  used  with  the  following  param-\neters:  BE  range  =  0–1100  eV,  pass  energy  =  80  eV,  step  size  =  0.4  eV,\nand  dwell  time  =  0.1  s.  To  better  understand  the  chemical  compo-\nsition  of  Ce  on  the  surface,  high  resolution  Ce  3d  spectra  were  also\ncollected,  where  applicable,  based  on  the  survey  spectra,  with  the\nfollowing  parameters:  BE  range  =  877–921  eV,  pass  energy  =  20  eV,\nstep  size  =  0.12  eV,  and  dwell  time  =  0.2  s.  The  collected  spectra\nwere  analyzed  using  the  CasaXPS  software  package  [13].  All  spec-\ntra  were  calibrated  to  the  C  1s  core-line  at  284.8  eV  arising  from\nthe  C  C/C  H  bonds  in  adventitious  carbon.  Core-lines  were  ﬁtted\nto  a  pseudo-Voight  lineshape  (70%  Gaussian,  30%  Lorentzian)  to\naccount  for  peak  broadening  after  the  background  was   removed\nusing  a  Shirley  function.  The  precision  of  the  binding  energies  is\n±0.1  eV  and  the  precision  of  the  compositional  analy-\nestimated  at \nsis  is  estimated  at \n\n±0.1%.\n\n2.5.  SEM  and  AES  measurements\n\nTo  investigate  the  particle–wafer  interaction  and  the  extent  of\nparticle  contamination,  SEM  and  Auger  electron  spectroscopy  was\nused  to  image  the  surfaces  and  perform  chemical  analysis  using  a\nJAMP-9500F  Auger  microprobe  (JEOL)  at  the  Alberta  Centre  for  Sur-\nface  Engineering  and  Science,  University  of  Alberta.  A  Schottky  ﬁeld\nemitter  was  used  to  produce  electron  probe  diameter  of  approxi-\nmately  3–8  nm  at  the  sample  surface.  The  SEM  and  Auger  imaging\nwere  done  with  an  accelerating  voltage  and  emission  current  of\n15  kV  and  8  nA,  respectively.  The  sample  was  rotated  at  30◦ to  face\nthe  electron  energy  analyzer.  Auger  spectroscopy  and  imaging  was\ncarried  out  with  a  M5   lens  with  0.6%  energy  resolution.\n\n3.  Results  and  discussion\n\n3.1.  Zeta  potential  measurements\n\nCoulombic  interactions  are  the  cause  for  adhesion  of  particles  to\nmany  surfaces  which,  in  general,  results  in  particle  contamination\non  wafer  surfaces.  Based  on  these  coulombic  interactions,  same  sur-\nface  charges  repel  while  opposite  charges  attract.  As  a  result  of  this\nphenomenon,  zeta  potential  measurements  of  ceria  particles  and\nsilica  surfaces  were  used  to  study  these  electrostatic  interactions.\nIn  order  to  investigate  the  surface  charge  of  ceria  particles  in  the\nslurry  and  the  charge  of  the  silica  surface,  the  zeta  potential  of  ceria\nand  silica  particles  were  measured  over  a  wide  pH  range  (3–13)\nas  shown  in  Fig.  1.  From  the  ﬁgure,  it  can  be  observed  that  silica\nhas  a  negative  zeta  potential  over  the  entire  pH  range  studied.  On\nthe  other  hand,  ceria  has  an  isoelectric  point  at  approximately  pH\n9.6;  the  ceria  zeta  potential  is  positive  for  pH  <  9.6  and  negative  for\npH  >  9.6.  Therefore,  positively  charged  ceria  particles  are  expected\nto  be  attracted  to  negatively  charged  silicon  dioxide  surface  over\nthe  pH  range  of  1–9.6  due  to  electrostatic  attraction  as  illustrated\nin  Fig.  2(a).  In  contrast,  for  pH  >  9.6  ceria  is  negatively  charged  and  is\nexpected  to  be  repelled  by  similarly  charged  silica  surface  as  repre-\nsented  in  Fig.  2(b).  Abiade  et  al.  [4]  reported  that  the  negative  charge\n\nFig.  1.  Zeta  potential  measurements  of  silica  and  ceria,  from  pH  3  to  13.\n\nthat  is  observed  for  the  silica  substrate  is  due  to  the  deprotonation\nof  surface  hydroxyls  according  to  the  following  equation:\n\nSi  OH \n\n↔\n\n  Si  O− +\n\n  H+\n\n(2)\n\nIn  our  experiments,  three  pH  values  were  selected  for  the  ceria\nslurry  which  are  6,  9  and  12,  representative  of  attractive,  neutral\nand  repulsive  pHs.  These  pHs  were  chosen  because  at  acidic  pH\nvalues,  the  ceria–silica  interactions  should  be  completely  attractive\nwhile  in  very  basic  media,  a  predominantly  repulsive  interaction  is\nexpected  since  both  surfaces  are  negatively  charged  according  to\nthe  zeta  potential  measurements.  pH  9  was  selected  as  it  was  found\nto  be  close  to  the  isoelectric  point  of  ceria  particles.  Therefore,  to\nminimize  ceria  particulate  contamination  on  the  silica  substrate,  a\nhigh  pH  is  required  so  both  surfaces  are  negatively  charged  and  a\nrepulsive  electrostatic  force  exists.\n\n3.2.  XPS  analysis\n\nXPS  is  a  surface  sensitive  technique  (sampling  between  3  and\n10  nm  [14]),  therefore,  it  is  ideally  suited  to  quantify  the  ceria\nremaining  on  the  Si  wafers;  however,  because  the  average  parti-\ncle  size  (∼5  nm,   as  determined  from  the  particle  size  distribution\ndiagram  shown  in  Fig.  S1)  is  well  below  the  maximum  sampling\ndepth,  XPS  also  provides  an  excellent  means  to  characterize  the\nceria  nanoparticles.  Thus,  it  was   important  to  examine  both  survey\nspectra,  and  high  resolution  Ce  3d  spectra.  The  surface  composition\nwas  determined  for  samples  1–3  (pH  6,  9,  and  12,  respectively).\nSurvey  spectra  obtained  are  shown  in  Fig.  3.\n\nAnalysis  of  the  as-received  surfaces  conﬁrmed  the  presence  of\nC,  O,  and  Si  (identiﬁed  with  C  1s,  O  1s,  and  Si  2s  core-lines),  as\nexpected,  on  all  samples.  Ce  was  detected  (identiﬁed  with  Ce  3d\ncore-line)  on  silica  samples  that  were  dipped  into  the  ceria  slurry\nat  pH  6  and  9,  with  the  greater  amount  present  on  the  silica  surface\nat  pH  6.  A  slight  excess  of  O  was   observed  in  the  pH  6  sample,  this  is\nprimarily  attributed  to  surface  hydration  and  oxidation  as  a  result\nof  exposure  to  atmosphere.  Ce  was  not  detected  in  the  pH  12  sample\n(Fig.  3(c)).\n\nThe  effect  of  slurry  pH  on  the  %  Ce  surface  concentration  is\nshown  in  Fig.  4.  The  composition  of  the  Ce  found  on  the  surface\nwas  at  the  highest  with  2.6%  for  the  pH  6  slurry,  while  only  a  trace\nof  Ce  was  detected  on  the  pH  9  slurry  sample  (<1%  atomic  concen-\ntration).  The  adhesion  in  sample  2  is  believed  to  be  weak  since  the\nceria  particles  are  not  electrostatically  attached  to  the  silica  surface\nand  the  ceria  particles  will  agglomerate  on  the  surface.  Unlike  the\nceria  particles  in  sample  1  (pH  6),  which  are  electrostatically  bound\nto  the  Si  surface,  those  in  sample  2  (pH  9)  adhere  in  a  different  way.\nOn  preparation  of  the  pH  9  ceria  slurry,  rapid  settling  was   observed.\n\n\f252 \n\nK.  Dawkins  et  al.  /  Applied  Surface  Science  345  (2015)  249–255\n\nFig.  2.  Schematic  representation  of  (a)  electrostatic  attraction  between  positively  charged  ceria  particle  and  negatively  charged  silica  surface  and  (b)  repulsive  force  between\nnegatively  charged  ceria  particle  and  silica  surface.\n\nThis  is  generally  attributed  to  the  formation  of  agglomerates  of\nunstable  CeO2 nanoparticles,  which  are  held  together  by  relatively\nweak  electrostatic  interactions  [5,15].  The  few  ceria  nanoparticles\nthat  remain  on  the  surface  are  probably  remnants  dislodged  from\nagglomerates  after  the  wafer  was  rinsed  with  DI  water.  Another\npossible  reason  for  this  is  that  ceria  and  silica  may   have  formed  a\nCe  O  Si  bond  at  pH  9,  but  this  could  not  be  conﬁrmed  from  the\nXPS  data.  The  absence  of  cerium  on  the  pH  12  slurry  sample  val-\nidated  our  theory  of  electrostatic  repulsion  between  same  charge\nsurfaces.\n\nHigh  resolution  Ce  3d  spectra  (Fig.  5)  show  signiﬁcant  ﬁne  struc-\nture,  induced  by  a  multitude  of  shakedown  satellite  features,  and\nare  difﬁcult  to  interpret.  The  complexity  of  Ce  3d  spectra  is  well\ndocumented  [16–26],  and  the  overall  lineshape  shown  in  Fig.  5  is\nconsistent  with  systems  of  mixed  Ce  valence  [17].  The  envelope\ncomprises  ten  different  peaks  that  can  be  further  categorized  into\nﬁve  spin–orbit  split,  3d5/2 and  3d3/2,  core–hole  pairs.  In  keeping\n\nwith  the  most  common  labelling  scheme,  we   denote  all  spin-up\n(j  =  5/2)  ﬁnal  states  as  v,  and  all  spin-down  (j  =  3/2)  as  u  [16].  The\npairs,  v/u,  v(cid:6)(cid:6)/u(cid:6)(cid:6),  and  v(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)/u(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6),  are  attributed  to  the  various  Ce(IV)  ﬁnal\nstates  (Ce  3d94f2 O  2p4,  Ce  3d94f1 O  2p5,  and  Ce  3d94f0 O  2p6,\nrespectively),  while  v0/u0,  and  v(cid:6)/u(cid:6),  are  associated  with  Ce(III)  ﬁnal\nstates,  Ce  3d94f2 O  2p5 and  Ce  3d94f1 O  2p6 [16,17].  Because  of  the\nincredible  complexity  in  a  Ce  3d  spectrum,  the  presence  of  the  u(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)\npeak  is  often  considered  a  ﬁngerprint  for  the  existence  of  Ce(IV)\n[17,23].  The  spin-orbit  splitting  is  approximately  18.3  eV  which  is\nconsistent  with  literature  values  [17,23].  The  peak  positions  and\ncompositional  data  are  tabulated  in  Table  1.\n\nBy  adding  the  component  peaks,  in  accordance  with  the  lit-\nerature  [24,25],  associated  with  both  Ce(III)  (v0 +  u0 +  v(cid:6) +  u(cid:6))  and\nCe(IV)  (v  +  v(cid:6)(cid:6) +  v(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6) +  u  +  u(cid:6)(cid:6) +  u(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)),  the  Ce(III)/Ce(IV)  composition  was\ndetermined  to  be  30.8%/69.3%.  It  is  clear  from  the  Ce  3d  spec-\ntrum  collected  at  pH  6  that  the  Ce  remaining  on  the  surface  is\nmostly  Ce(IV).

Interactions\nbetween  silicon-based  substrates  and  deposited  thin  ﬁlms  are  doc-\numented  and  varied.  Some  cases  (e.g.  TiO2 on  SiO2 [27])  report\ntemperature-dependent  Si  diffusion  from  the  substrate  into  the\ntarget  ﬁlm,  while  other  cases  suggest  interfacial  reaction  as  in\nthe  formation  of  cerium  silicate  species  in  heat  treated  CeO2/Si\nﬁlms  [24,26].  The  amount  of  Ce(III)  present  in  this  work  (∼31%)\nis  consistent  with  that  reported  in  the  previously  mentioned  thin-\nﬁlm  studies  [24,26]  where  it  is  largely  attributed  to  the  reduction\nof  CeO2 to  Ce2Si2O7 and  various  cerium  sub-oxides  (Ce2O3,  and\nCe7O12).  The  extent  to  which  the  silicate  formation  applies  to  the\nnon-heated  nanoparticles  presented  here  is  unclear.  The  use  of\nnanoparticles  will  decrease  the  overall  interfacial  surface  area  as\ncompared  to  a  thin  ﬁlm,  but  it  will  increase  the  surface  area  avail-\nable  for  surface  hydration  and  sub-oxide  formation.  It  is  likely  that\nthe  true  picture  is  a  mixture  of  both  scenarios.\n\nFig.  4.  %  Ce  remaining  on  the  silica  surface  after  exposure  to  different  pH  ceria\nslurries.\n\n3.3.

All  features  discussed  previously  with  the  pH  6  sample  per-\nsist  in  the  pH  9  sample,  as  highlighted  by  the  vertical  dashed  lines,\nhowever  the  signiﬁcantly  decreased  concentration  of  particles\n\nFig.  5.  High  resolution  Ce  3d  XPS  spectra  for  samples  treated  at  pH  6  and  9.  pH\n6   (baseline)  component  peaks  are  labelled  as  v/u  (spin-up/spin-down)  core–hole\npairs.  The  vertical  dashed  lines  mark  the  peak  positions  for  comparison  with  the  pH\n9   sample  (raised).\n\nScanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM)  of  the  sample  surfaces\n(Fig.  6)  clearly  showed  the  presence  of  a  number  of  particles  on\nthe  silica  surface  at  pH  6,  a  fewer  number  at  pH  9,  and  no  parti-\ncles  at  pH  12,  in  agreement  with  the  XPS  data  and  the  electrostatic\nmodel.  Ceria  is  an  insulator  and  appears  as  small  white  dots  due\nto  charging.  Fig.  6(a)  shows  uniform  ceria  particle  distribution  on\nthe  silica  surface  conﬁrms  particle  contamination  when  both  sur-\nfaces  are  oppositely  charged.  Since  the  ceria  particles  have  the  same\ncharge,  they  tend  to  distribute  uniformly  when  they  electrostat-\nically  attach  to  silica.  However,  at  pH  9,  a  non-uniform  particle\ndistribution  on  the  substrate  is  observed  as  shown  in  Fig.  6(b).  It\nwas  also  observed  that  the  number  of  ceria  particles  that  can  be\nseen  on  the  substrate  is  signiﬁcantly  less  than  at  pH  6  and  the  ceria\nparticles  appear  agglomerated  in  contrast  to  the  particles  at  pH  6\nwhich  tend  to  be  more  individual.  This  is  in  agreement  with  pre-\nvious  studies,  which  showed  that  over  a  pH  range  of  7–10.5,  ceria\nparticles  tend  to  agglomerate  quickly  due  to  particle–particle  bond-\ning  of  unstable  ceria  particles  [15].  The  SEM  of  the  pH  12  sample,\nshown  in  Fig.  6(c),  serves  as  a  visual  conﬁrmation  of  the  absence  of\nceria  particles  noted  from  the  XPS  data.\n\nAuger  electron  spectroscopy  mapping  was  done  on  both  the  pH\n6  and  pH  9  samples  to  conﬁrm  the  presence  of  ceria.  Two  different\npoints  were  measured  per  sample;  the  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  7.\nThe  images,  Fig.  7(a)  and  (d),  for  pH  6  and  9  respectively,  show\nsimilar  results  to  the  previously  discussed  SEM  images  in  Fig.  6.\nThe  particles  deposited  on  the  wafer  at  pH  6  are  generally  much\nsmaller  (largely  invisible  due  to  the  much  larger  scale  bar  when\ncompared  to  the  SEM),  with  less  overall  agglomeration  than  with\nthe  pH  9  sample.  The  Auger  spectra  (shown  in  Fig.  7(b),  (c),  (e),  and\n(f)  as  the  signal  derivative)  all  show  the  presence  of  Ce,  O,  and  Si,  in\n\n\f254 \n\nK.

Carbon  was  detected  in  both  points\nof  the  pH  9  sample  but  not  in  the  pH  6  sample  (carbon  was   detected\nin  all  XPS  survey  spectra).  This  discrepancy  is  likely  the  result  of  a\nslightly  longer  exposure  to  atmosphere  for  the  pH  9  sample  result-\ning  in  a  buildup  of  dust  and  adventitious  carbon.  We   consider  the\npoints  measured  to  be  representative  of  sample  surfaces.\n\n4.  Conclusions\n\nThe  removal  of  ceria  abrasives  from  silica  surfaces  has  been  eval-\nuated  using  XPS,  SEM,  and  AES.  The  zeta  potential  of  ceria  exhibited\na  positive  surface  charge  in  the  pH  range  of  3–9.6  with  an  IEP  at\napproximately  pH  9.6  and  a  negative  surface  charge  for  pH  >  9.6\nwhile  silica  maintained  a  negative  surface  charge  in  the  pH  range  of\n3–13.  Based  on  the  zeta  potential  measurements,  it  was   suggested\nthat  a  high  pH  (>9)  is  required  to  prevent  ceria  particles  from  inter-\nacting  with  silica  surface  due  to  electrostatic  repulsion.  This  was\nexplained  using  coulombic  interactions  and  was  conﬁrmed  by  the\nexperimental  ﬁndings  (XPS,  SEM  and  AES).  Of  the  tested  samples,\n\nthe  adhesion  of  ceria  particles  to  the  silica  substrate  was   greatest\nat  pH  6  and  decreased  through  pH  9,  where  only  limited  adhesion\nwas  observed,  to  pH  12,  for  which  the  silica  wafer  was  devoid  of\nceria.  Ceria  present  on  the  surface  at  pH  6  was   shown,  through  high-\n∼31%:69%  ratio\nresolution  Ce  3d  XPS  analysis,  to  be  composed  of  a \nof  Ce(III):Ce(IV).  The  pH  9  sample  showed  similar  lineshape,  and,\nlikely,  a  similar  Ce(III):Ce(IV)  ratio,  however  the  decrease  magni-\ntude  prevented  any  meaningful  quantitative  analysis.  Based  on  XPS,\nSEM  and  AES  analyses,  it  is  clear  that  an  interaction  exists  between\nthe  ceria  and  silica  surfaces,  however,  the  nature  of  this  interaction\nwas  not  studied  in  detail  and  will  be  investigated  in  subsequent\nwork.\n\nIn  addition,  it  is  suggested  that  for  the  cleaning  process  in  CMP,\npH  modiﬁcation  can  be  used  of  the  slurry  may   be  a  useful  strategy\nto  enhance  cleaning  of  the  wafer.  This  work  has  demonstrated  that\nthe  optimum  pH  for  obtaining  a  clean  silica  surface,  after  exposure\nto  a  ceria  slurry,  is  pH  >  9.6,  and  we   know  from  previous  work  that\nthe  preferred  pH  for  the  polishing  of  silica  substrates  with  ceria\nis  approximately  pH  4  [5].  To  rectify  this,  one  possible  approach\n\n\fK.  Dawkins  et  al.  /  Applied  Surface  Science  345  (2015)  249–255 \n\n255\n\nwould  be  to  polish  wafers  with  optimum  removal  pH,  and  conclude\nthe  last  few  seconds  of  the  polish  process  with  a  high  pH  slurry  by\nadding  potassium  hydroxide,  for  example,  to  the  polishing  slurry\non  the  pad.  Emphasis  should  be  placed  on  designing  slurries  that\nlimit  contact  between  the  abrasive  and  the  substrate,  at  least  in  the\nﬁnal  stage  of  the  polish  process.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe  authors  would  like  to  thank  the  Natural  Sciences  and  Engi-\nneering  Research  Council  of  Canada  for  funding  this  work,  and\nDr.  Lucy  Nolan  for  many  insightful  discussions.
