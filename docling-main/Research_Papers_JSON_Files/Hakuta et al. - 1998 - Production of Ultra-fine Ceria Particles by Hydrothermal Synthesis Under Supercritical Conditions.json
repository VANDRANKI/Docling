Recently, ceria ﬁne particles have been\nused in fuel battery materials and various sensor\nmaterials [1]. The size requirements of the ceria ﬁne\nparticles depend on the particular application, but, in\ngeneral, it is desirable for the particles to have a\nnarrow size distribution. For polishing applications,\nparticle sizes tend to be of sub-micrometer order\nwhereas for ceramic materials, particle sizes are\ntypically of nanometer order [2].\n\nTC\n\nTC\n\nTC\n\npump\n\nDegasser\n\nheater\n\nwater\n\nTC\n\nTC\n\nDegasser\n\npump\n\nreactor\n\nTC\ncooling\nwater jacket\n\nCe(NO3)3\nsolution\n\n3way valvue\n\nin-line\nfilter\n\nBack\npressure\nregulator\n\nor\n\nprecursors\n\nCeria ﬁne particles can be produced by thermal\ndecomposition [3–4], ﬂash combustion [5–6], sol–\ngel [7–8], precipitation [2] and hydrothermal syn-\nthesis [9–11] methods. Products formed by thermal\ndecomposition and combustion give large aggrega-\ntions of nearly 10 (cid:236)m, making these techniques\ndifﬁcult to adapt to nanometer particle production.\nFor the case of sol–gel and precipitation, calcination\ntemperatures\ngels\nof\n(. 1000 8C)\nto produce cerium oxide, additional\ntreatment (a grinding and classiﬁcation) is necessary\nto obtain ultra-ﬁne particles with narrow size\nlower\ndistribution [8]. Hydrothermal synthesis at\ntemperatures (, 300 8C) is a well-known method for\nmetal oxide ﬁne particles [9–11]. Hydrothermal\nsynthesis does not\nrequire calcination and can\nproduce nanometer-size particles. However, hydro-\nthermal techniques require long heat treatment for\nseveral hours because of the slow reaction rate.\n\nhigh\n\nat\n\nWe have proposed a rapid and continuous method\nfor production of metal oxide particles using super-\ncritical water as the reaction media [12–13]. The\nresults of those studies suggest that the method has\npotential to change particle morphology and particle\nsize because of its controllable thermodynamics and\ntransport properties. Through these studies, we also\nfound that ultra-ﬁne particles could be preferentially\nproduced. This letter focuses on the production of\nultra-ﬁne ceria particles by the supercritical water\n(SCW) hydrothermal synthesis method.\n\nAqueous cerium nitrate solution (0.05 mol=L) was\nprepared by dissolving Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Kanto\nChemicals Inc., Tokyo) into distilled water. Fig. 1\nshows the schematic diagram of the experimental\napparatus. Cerium nitrate aqueous solution was fed\nby a high-pressure pump (NP-AX-15, Nihon Sei-\nmitsu Kagaku, Tokyo) with a ﬂow rate of\n2 cm3=min. The solution was mixed with pre-heated\n\n0261-8028 # 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers\n\nFigure 1 Flow apparatus for producing ﬁne particles in subcritical and\nsupercritical water.\n\nwater ((cid:24) 450 8C), which was fed through another\nline at a ﬂow rate of 6 cm3=min. The solution was\nrapidly heated to the desired reaction temperature at\nthe mixing point, and the reaction occurred. The\nreactor was maintained at the reaction temperature\nby an external heater. At the outlet of the reactor, the\nsolution was cooled by a water jacket. Pressure in\nthe system was held at 30 MPa with a back pressure\nregulator (Model 26-1722-24, Tescom Corp., Elk\nRiver) at the exit. Residence time of the solution in\nthe reactor was varied by changing reactor volume,\nwhich was set to be 0:15 (cid:24) 7:7 cm3. The residence\ntime was evaluated from the reactor volume, density\nof pure water at\nthe reaction temperature and\npressure and total ﬂow rate, where the density of\nsolution was assumed to be that of pure water\nand\ndensity at\npressure.\n\nthe given system temperature\n\nParticle-water suspensions recovered were ﬁltered\nwith a membrane ﬁlter\n(0.1 (cid:236)m), and then the\npowders were oven-dried at 60 8C for 24 h. Observa-\ntion of particle morphology, and measurement of\nparticle size and particle size distribution, was per-\nformed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nand transmission electron microscopy (TEM)(H-\n8010, Hitachi, Tokyo). The crystal structure of the\npowders obtained was analyzed by X-ray diffraction\n(XRD) using CuKÆ radiation (Model 2013, Rigaku,\nTokyo).

Inductively coupled\nplasma (ICP) analysis (SPS-1200, Seiko, Tokyo) was\nused to determine the concentration of Ce ion in the\nsolution recovered, from which conversion of cerium\nnitrate was evaluated.\n\nTable I summarizes the experimental conditions\nand results. At 200 8C, the outlet solution was clear,\nbut\nit appeared as a particle-water suspension at\nhigher temperatures (. 250 8C). From the results of\nXRD analysis, products were CeO2. Above the\ncritical temperature (374 8C), conversion of cerium\nreaction time (0:4 (cid:24) 0:6\nnitrate at\nthe\nseconds) was nearly 100%. This implied that\nhydrolysis reaction was complete and that a great\namount of monomers were produced within an\nextremely short time.\n\nthe shortest\n\nIn comparing results under various\n\nreaction\ntemperatures, particle sizes became much smaller\nat\ntemperatures higher than the critical point of\nwater (374 8C). Regarding particle growth during the\nobservation period, particles became larger with\nincreasing residence time at subcritical conditions,\nwhereas particles grew little under\nsupercritical\nconditions.\n\nFig. 2 shows SEM photographs of ceria particles\nobtained at various residence times at 300 8C. At\n300 8C, characteristic octahedron ceria particles were\nproduced. Particles grew with increasing residence\ntime, as shown in Fig. 2 and also Table I. At 400 8C,\nproducts formed an aggregation on the membrane\nﬁlter and had a size of 70 (cid:24) 120 nm, as shown in the\nSEM photograph in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 shows a TEM\nphotograph of the same products. Ultra-ﬁne particles\nof about 20 nm with an octahedron shape were\nobserved. From the XRD analysis with Sharer’s\nformula, the crystalline size of these products was\nabout 20 nm and did not vary with increasing\n\nFigure 4 TEM photograph of the CeO2 powder produced at the same\nconditions as Figure 3.

Although a detailed mechanism cannot be\nclariﬁed at\nthe formation of ultra-ﬁne\nparticles in supercritical water seems to be attributed\nto the extremely high hydrolysis reaction rate and the\nlow solvent power of supercritical water that most\nlikely leads to a high degree of supersaturation.\n\nthis point,\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis\ninvestigation has been supported by the\nfollowing: Monbusho Grant-in-Aid for Scientiﬁc\nResearch on Priority Areas (04238292, 05222203,\n06214202); Monbusho Grant-in-Aid for Scientiﬁc\nResearch (07405036).\n\nReferences\n1.
