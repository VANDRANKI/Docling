Rare earth carbonates, as precursors\nof ceria-based abrasives, directly affect the morphology of ceria-based abrasives, which, in turn,\naffects the material removal rate (MRR) and the surface roughness (Ra) after polishing. Herein, rare\nearth carbonates with different morphologies were obtained by adjusting reaction parameters during\nprecipitation, including ﬂake, spindle, and spheroid. Moreover, the phase of precursors was analyzed,\nand the evolution process of morphology from precursors to ceria-based abrasives was investigated.\nFurthermore, the effect of precursors on the polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives was\nexplored. The results show that the primary particles of ceria-based abrasives are near-spherical, but\nthe morphology and dispersion of the secondary particles are obviously inherited from precursors.\nAmong them, near-spherical ceria-based abrasives prepared by nearly monodisperse near-spherical\nprecursors show better uniformity and higher dispersion, and they not only achieve the lowest Ra but\nalso obtain a higher MRR of 555 nm/min (9 wt.%) for polishing TFT-LCD glass substrates. The result\nis signiﬁcant for the further optimization and application of high-performance ceria-based abrasives.\n\nKeywords: ceria-based abrasives; rare earth precursors; chemical mechanical polishing; TFT-LCD\nglass substrates\n\n1. Introduction\n\nCeria-based abrasives are an important CMP-polishing material, which are widely\nused in polishing glass, the substrate of materials devices, and other silica-containing\nmaterials, due to its uniform particle size, moderate hardness, high polishing efﬁciency,\nand excellent polishing quality [1–6]. It has been paid attention to glass substrate polishing\nbecause of its greater application prospects. The TFT-LCD glass substrates are used in the\nthin ﬁlm transistor liquid crystal display, which is a key strategic material in the electronic\ninformation display industry. Their surface machining accuracy is directly related to\nthe display panel’s resolution, transmittance, and other key performance indicators [7,8].\nThe TFT-LCD glass substrates are divided by the area in the display industry, and it is\ngenerally considered that the 6th generation line and below is the low generation, and\nthe 8.5 generation line (2200 mm×2500 mm) and above is the high generation. The high\ngeneration conforms to the development trend of the future large-screen and multi-screen\nera, and market demand is increasing. The high-generation TFT-LCD glass substrate is thin\nand soft, so the polishing accuracy is extremely strict. A single piece of high-generation\nglass substrate has an area of more than 5.5 m2 and a thickness of only a few hundred\nmicrometers. The polished glass substrate is required to have high ﬂatness and smoothness.\n\nCitation: Zheng, Y.; Wang, N.; Feng,\n\nZ.; Tan, X.; Zhang, Z.; Han, H.;\n\nHuang, X.

Ceria-based abrasives\nand polished substrates polished exhibit chemical and mechanical interactions in the\nCMP process, and mechanical interactions play a dominant role [10–12]. The morphology\nof abrasives is a very important factor in the CMP process. It can signiﬁcantly affect\nthe polishing performance and CMP-induced defects, such as erosion and dishing [13].\nTherefore, the morphology of ceria-based abrasives needs to be further optimized because\nof its signiﬁcant impact on polishing performance.\n\nCurrently, the commonly used preparation method of ceria-based abrasives mainly\nincludes three processes, which are precipitation, ﬂuorination, and calcination [14–16].\nHowever, high-precision classiﬁcation is adopted to reasonably control the size of ceria-\nbased abrasives [17,18]. The morphology and structure of ceria-based abrasives determine\ntheir polishing performance, so the inﬂuence of different process parameters on ceria-\nbased abrasives has been studied extensively [19]. The ﬂuorination can improve the\ndispersity of particles and the ceria-based abrasives’ MRR for the glass by introducing the\nﬂuridizer [20,21]. The ﬂuorine (F) atoms can signiﬁcantly improve the chemical activity\nof ceria in the polishing process, as well as enhance its polishing performance, and it\ncan form LaOF and LaF3. However, LaF3 with low hardness is easily crushed during\npolishing, which lowers the MRR and shortens the useful life of ceria-based abrasives.\nHydroﬂuoric acid (HF) is widely used as a ﬂuridizer because of its better reaction rate\nand reaction uniformity, but excessive addition can damage the polished glass surface and\nincrease the Ra [22]. In addition, calcination directly impacts phase structures and surface\nproperties of ceria-based abrasives [19,23,24]. It was found for the ceria-based abrasives\nthat the MRR increases with the calcination temperature. In the temperature range of\nca. 300–700 ◦C, not only do the physical characteristics of ceria-based abrasives change\ndramatically, but so do their chemical activities [25,26]. However, there are still relatively\nfew studies that demonstrate clear relationships of precursors, ceria-based abrasives, and\npolishing performance.\n\nRare earth carbonates are precipitation precursors, which are widely used in the\nindustrial production of ceria-based abrasives. Previous research has shown that there\nare many types of rare earth carbonates, including rare-earth carbonates (RE2(CO3)3) [27],\nhydroxycarbonates (REOHCO3) [28], oxycarbonate hydrates (RE2O(CO3)2·H2O), and di-\noxycarbonates (RE2O2CO3) (where RE represents a rare-earth ion) [29–31], which have\nbeen studied extensively at the nano- and micro-scale. In addition, rare earth carbonates\nwith a broad range of morphologies can be obtained by different synthetic methods and\nexperimental conditions, including spherical particles, triangular microplates, nanorods,\nnanoplates, etc. [32]. The urea homogenous precipitation method was the ﬁrst technique\nemployed to synthesize monodispersed spherical particles of rare earth carbonates [33].\nNanorods and nanoplates of rare earth carbonates can be obtained by altering counter\nanions [34]. Rare earth carbonates as precursors of ceria-based abrasives, their phase\nstructures, and morphologies directly affect the physicochemical characteristics of abrasives\nand further affect their polishing rate and polishing precision. However, ordinary ceria-\nbased abrasives are commonly prepared by ﬂake-like rare earth carbonates in industrial\nproduction, which is the main reason for the low polishing accuracy.\n\nHere, this work focus on the effects of rare earth carbonates on the morphology and\nchemical mechanical polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives. Rare earth carbonates\nwith different phase structures and morphologies were synthesized by altering conditions\nduring precipitation, where ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) and lanthanum-cerium\nsulfate mixed liquid ((Ce0.7, La0.3)2(SO4)3·xH2O) were used as raw materials, and La\nwas added to improve the polishing performance of abrasives [35,36]. Then, ceria-based\nabrasives were obtained by ﬂuorating and calcinating rare earth carbonates with different\nshapes, and the effect of precursors on the morphology of ceria-based abrasives was studied.\nFurthermore, the CMP process of ceria-based abrasives prepared by different precursors\n\n\fMaterials 2022, 15, 7525\n\n3 of 11\n\nwas evaluated, and TFT-LCD glass substrates were used as polishing workpieces. The\neffect of precursors on the polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives was investigated.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1.

Polishing Measurements The polishing process of ceria-based abrasives for TFT-LCD glass substrates was per-formed by a high-precision laboratory polishing machine (ProLap-15).

Characterization The size and morphology of ceria-based abrasives were observed with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) (SEM, JEOL, Akishima, Japan, JSM-7900F). The phase analysis of ceria-based abrasives was achieved by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Smart-lab, Tokyo, Japan, 9KW) equipped with Cu-Kα radiation.

Results and Discussion Figure 2 shows SEM images of rare earth carbonates obtained by different precipita-tion conditions, which are flake-like precursors (F-precursors), spindle-like precursors (S-precursors), and near-spherical precursors (N-precursors). It can be seen that F-precursors are made up of many irregular thin sheets stacked (Figure 2a,d). S-precursors and N-pre-cursors have uniform size and morphology, where the former has an average length of ~900 nm and a diameter of ~200 nm, and the latter has an average particle size of ~50nm. Moreover, N-precursors are nearly monodispersed. The synthesis of rare earth carbonates with different morphologies was achieved by controlling precipitation reaction condi-tions.  Figure 2.

Figure 3\nshows the presence of amorphous phases for the N-precursors and F-precursors because of\nthe low precipitation temperature, and it can be solved by calcination. Extensive literature\nindicates that different factors have effects on the phase and morphology of rare-earth\ncarbonate particles. The reaction temperature is a parameter that allows easy control\nover the size and shape of rare earth carbonate particles [33]. In this work, the escape\nrate of carbon dioxide from rare earth carbonates was accelerated to a certain extent by\nincreasing the reaction temperature and (Ce, La)2O(CO3)2·xH2O were formed [23]. The\nphase structures of precursors with different morphologies are different. XRD results show\nthat F-precursors have the stronger <200> crystal plane and the un-conspicuous <101>\ncrystal plane than N-precursors. According to crystal growth theory, the shape of the\ncrystal depends on the relative growth rate of each crystal face. In this work, it shows\nthat the morphology of precursors is affected by the relative growth rate of each crystal\nface [37,38], and the crystal plane of F-precursors and N-precursors with identical phases\ngrow differently, so the morphology of precursors is different.\n\nFigure 3. XRD diffraction patterns of different precursors.\n\nFurthermore, precursors with different morphologies and phases were ﬂuorinated\nand calcined to obtain ceria-based abrasives. Figure 4 shows SEM images of ceria-based\nabrasives, which are ﬂake-like (F-abrasives), spindle-like (S-abrasives), and near-spherical\n(N-abrasives), respectively. It can be seen from Figure 4 that the morphology and the\ndispersity of secondary particles about ceria-based abrasives are inherited from their\nprecursors. However, the morphology of primary particles is almost near-spherical because\nof the etching of the HF solution. Moreover, primary particles’ sizes are close, and the\naverage size is ~50 nm. This result may be attributed to the consistent conditions in the\nﬂuorination, such as the concentration and the additive amount of HF solution. Among\nthem, the size of N-abrasives does not change obviously, compared with their precursors.\nThe reason is that the particle size of near-spherical precursors is small (~50 nm) and close to\nthe primary particle size of abrasives, and it is difﬁcult to etch into smaller particles on the\noriginal basis during ﬂuorination. In a word, rare earth carbonates affect the morphology\nof ceria-based abrasives, and there is an apparent inheritance relationship for secondary\nparticles between them.\n\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 11   XRD diffraction patterns of precipitation precursors in Figure 3 are shown to further analyze the phase structures. F-precursors and N-precursors are rare earth carbonate ((Ce, La)2(CO3)3·4H2O, JCPDS 00-006-0076), while S-precursors are mainly composed of rare earth oxycarbonate hydrate ((Ce, La)2O(CO3)2·xH2O, JCPDS 00-044-0617). Figure 3 shows the presence of amorphous phases for the N-precursors and F-precursors because of the low precipitation temperature, and it can be solved by calcination. Extensive literature indicates that different factors have effects on the phase and morphology of rare-earth carbonate particles. The reaction temperature is a parameter that allows easy control over the size and shape of rare earth carbonate particles [33]. In this work, the escape rate of carbon dioxide from rare earth carbonates was accelerated to a certain extent by increasing the reaction temperature and (Ce, La)2O(CO3)2·xH2O were formed [23]. The phase struc-tures of precursors with different morphologies are different. XRD results show that F-precursors have the stronger <200> crystal plane and the un-conspicuous <101> crystal plane than N-precursors. According to crystal growth theory, the shape of the crystal de-pends on the relative growth rate of each crystal face. In this work, it shows that the mor-phology of precursors is affected by the relative growth rate of each crystal face [37,38], and the crystal plane of F-precursors and N-precursors with identical phases grow differ-ently, so the morphology of precursors is different.  Figure 3. XRD diffraction patterns of different precursors. Furthermore, precursors with different morphologies and phases were fluorinated and calcined to obtain ceria-based abrasives. Figure 4 shows SEM images of ceria-based abrasives, which are flake-like (F-abrasives), spindle-like (S-abrasives), and near-spherical (N-abrasives), respectively. It can be seen from Figure 4 that the morphology and the dis-persity of secondary particles about ceria-based abrasives are inherited from their precur-sors.

This result may be attributed to the consistent conditions in the fluori-nation, such as the concentration and the additive amount of HF solution. Among them, the size of N-abrasives does not change obviously, compared with their precursors. The reason is that the particle size of near-spherical precursors is small (~50 nm) and close to the primary particle size of abrasives, and it is difficult to etch into smaller particles on the original basis during fluorination. In a word, rare earth carbonates affect the morphology of ceria-based abrasives, and there is an apparent inheritance relationship for secondary particles between them. \fMaterials 2022, 15, 7525\n\n6 of 11\n\nFigure 4.

Among them, the size distribution of S-abrasives\nwith double peaks corresponds to their morphology. F-abrasives and S-abrasives have\nlarge particles after calcination, so they need to be further classiﬁed before the CMP. In\nthis study, airﬂow classiﬁcation is used to classify calcined products. The overall particle\nsize distribution of graded F-abrasives and S-abrasives particles was consistent with that\nof ungraded N-abrasives particles (Figure 6b). The three kinds of abrasives have the\nsame particle size distribution by adjusting airﬂow classiﬁcation parameters. Further, the\nabrasives slurry with different concentrations was prepared. The polishing performance of\nceria-based abrasives for TFT-LCD glass substrates was further evaluated.\n\nFigure 6. Particle size distributions of unclassiﬁed (a) and classiﬁed (b) ceria-based abrasives.\n\nFigure 7a shows the Ra of TFT-LCD glass substrates polished by the ceria-based\nabrasives slurry with different concentrations. In this study, the average height differ-\nence within a certain area (0.86 mm × 0.86 mm) was calculated as the Ra. It can be seen\nfrom Figure 7a that N-abrasives always achieve a lower Ra than those of F-abrasives\nand S-abrasives in the concentration range of 1–9 wt.%. The Ra of F-abrasives and\nS-abrasives are more than 1.5 nm, but the Ra of N-abrasives is less than 1 nm at the\nappropriate concentration. Therefore, N-abrasives’ polishing quality is better because of\ntheir higher dispersion and homogeneity. Figure 7b shows the MRR of ceria-based abra-\nsives with different morphologies. It can be seen that the MRR of three kinds of ceria-based\nabrasives increases with the increase in the slurry concentration. The MRR of F-abrasives is\nhigher, and the MRR of N-abrasives is lower at the same concentration than F-abrasives.\nThe shape of F-abrasives is irregular and angular, so the MRR is higher. By contrast, the\nmorphology and size of N-abrasives are more uniform, so the MRR of N-abrasives is lower\nthan F-abrasives at the same concentration. Their MRR increases with the increase in the\nconcentration over a certain range, and the value of MRR reaches to 555 nm/min when the\nconcentration is 9 wt.%. However, the MRR of F-abrasives and S-abrasives decreases with\nthe increase in concentration from 7 wt.% to 9 wt.%. The main reason is that a higher con-\ncentration is easy to cause particle accumulation on the glass surface under experimental\nconditions, reducing the effective contact area [39,40]. Additionally, when the abrasives\nslurry concentration is high, the particle size after agglomeration is larger. Because the\npolishing pad is in direct contact with the raised parts of the TFT-LCD glass substrates,\nnot all particles play a role (Figure 8). In addition, the polishing pad will produce recesses,\nand a number of small particles will be trapped under polishing pressure. The larger the\nfunctioning particles, the deeper the recesses will happen, and the small particles will be\ntrapped and make no sense [41,42]. On the contrary, the proportion of functioned particles\nto all the particles in the slurry will increase due to the better uniformity and dispersity of\nabrasives slurry with lower concentration. Thus, high concentrations do not consistently\nincrease the MRR for F-abrasives and S-abrasives, and the MRR of N-abrasives increases\nwith the increase in the slurry concentration.\n\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 11   However, ceria-based abrasives tend to agglomerate after calcination, so further grading is a necessary process to achieve application requirements. Figure 6 shows parti-cle size distributions of ceria-based abrasives with different morphologies before and after classification. As shown in Figure 6a, unclassified F-abrasives and N-abrasives have the largest and smallest size, respectively. Among them, the size distribution of S-abrasives with double peaks corresponds to their morphology. F-abrasives and S-abrasives have large particles after calcination, so they need to be further classified before the CMP. In this study, airflow classification is used to classify calcined products. The overall particle size distribution of graded F-abrasives and S-abrasives particles was consistent with that of ungraded N-abrasives particles (Figure 6b). The three kinds of abrasives have the same particle size distribution by adjusting airflow classification parameters. Further, the abra-sives slurry with different concentrations was prepared. The polishing performance of ceria-based abrasives for TFT-LCD glass substrates was further evaluated.  Figure 6.

Figure 7a shows the Ra of TFT-LCD glass substrates polished by the ceria-based abra-sives slurry with different concentrations. In this study, the average height difference within a certain area (0.86 mm × 0.86 mm) was calculated as the Ra. It can be seen from Figure 7a that N-abrasives always achieve a lower Ra than those of F-abrasives and S-abrasives in the concentration range of 1–9 wt.%. The Ra of F-abrasives and S-abrasives are more than 1.5 nm, but the Ra of N-abrasives is less than 1 nm at the appropriate con-centration. Therefore, N-abrasives’ polishing quality is better because of their higher dis-persion and homogeneity. Figure 7b shows the MRR of ceria-based abrasives with differ-ent morphologies. It can be seen that the MRR of three kinds of ceria-based abrasives in-creases with the increase in the slurry concentration. The MRR of F-abrasives is higher, and the MRR of N-abrasives is lower at the same concentration than F-abrasives. The shape of F-abrasives is irregular and angular, so the MRR is higher. By contrast, the mor-phology and size of N-abrasives are more uniform, so the MRR of N-abrasives is lower than F-abrasives at the same concentration.

The morphology of ceria-based abrasives can signiﬁcantly affect\nthe MRR and the Ra [43]. Further, F-abrasive and S-abrasive with a morphology of edges\nand corners can obtain the higher MRR because of the greater force, but they also cause\nthe presence of CMP-induced defects, for example, micro-scratches. Therefore, ceria-based\nabrasives with different morphologies exhibit different polishing performances.

Conclusions\n\nPrecipitation precursors with different morphologies and phases were obtained by\naltering the reaction conditions in the precipitation. The effect of precursors on the mor-\nphology of ceria-based abrasives was explored. The result shows that the morphology\nand dispersity of secondary particles inherit their precursors, and primary particles of\nabrasives are almost near-spherical with a size of ~50 nm because of the etching of HF\nsolution. Therefore, rare earth carbonates with high dispersion and homogeneity are more\nconducive to obtaining high uniformity ceria-based abrasives.\n\nFurthermore, the effect of precursors on the CMP performance of ceria-based abrasives\nwas explored. High-performance ceria-based abrasives need to achieve a high MRR and\ngood polishing quality (a low Ra) at the same time. Although F-abrasives have a higher\nMRR (>500 nm/min), more scratches (Ra > 2 nm) are caused by their irregular morphology.\nBy contrast, near-spherical ceria-based abrasives are beneﬁcial to improving the polishing\ncontact area and reducing mechanical damage. N-abrasives obtained by N-precursors\nhave the characteristics of uniform morphology, narrow size, and high dispersion, which\nnot only achieves a high MRR (9 wt.%, 555 nm/min) but also reaches excellent polishing\nquality to TFT-LCD glass substrates, including the lower Ra (<1.5 nm) and fewer scratches.\nTherefore, rare earth carbonates with high dispersion and homogeneity are more conducive\nto obtaining high-performance ceria-based abrasives.
