  "text": "CMP slurries are formulated with a combination of abrasive particles and chemical additives. As the name implies, the abrasive particles provide a mechanical scouring action that helps remove material from the surface of the wafer. With few exceptions, the abrasive particles are comprised of alumina, ceria, or amorphous silica (Al2O3, CeO2, SiO2). Depending on the particular application, the size of the abrasive particles may be from approximately 10 to 200 nm, but typically fall within a narrow normally distributed range.",
