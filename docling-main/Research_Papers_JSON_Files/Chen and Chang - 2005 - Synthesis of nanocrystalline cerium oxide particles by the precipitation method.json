Introduction\n\nIn recent years, nanocrystalline cerium oxide (CeO2)\nparticles have been extensively studied owing to their\npotential uses in many applications, such as UV absorbents\nand ﬁlters [1,2], buffer layers with silicon wafer [3], gas\nsensors [4], catalysts in the fuel cell technology [5–7],\ncatalytic wet oxidation [8], engine exhaust catalysts [9], NO\nremoval [10], photocatalytic oxidation of water [11], etc.\nHowever, the material performances in practical uses are\nstrongly inﬂuenced by the properties of constituent CeO2\nparticles.\n\nNumerous techniques have been proposed to synthesize\nnano-sized CeO2 particles with promising control of\nproperties, such as hydrothermal [12–16], reverse micelles\n[1,17], sonochemical [18], pyrolysis [19] and homogeneous\nprecipitation [2,20–24]. Among them, owing to the\n\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +886 6 2757575; fax: +886 6 2344496.\n\nE-mail address: hueying@mail.ncku.edu.tw (H.-I. Chen).\n\nadvantages of simple process, easy scale-up and low cost,\nthe precipitation technique has attracted the most extensive\nattentions. For example, Zhou et al. [20] produced CeO2\nparticles of about 4 nm from cerium nitrate and ammonia.\nMatijevic´ and Hsu [21] prepared sub-micron Ce2O-\n(CO3)2(cid:1)H2O particles from cerium nitrate with urea. Chen\nand Chen [22] prepared CeO2 particles from cerium nitrate\nwith hexamethylenetetramine, whereas Li et al. [23] used\nammonia carbonate and diethylamine as the precipitate\nagents. Yamashita et al. [2] produced CeO2 particles from\ncerium chloride and sodium hydroxide with the presence of\nhydrogen peroxide under various pH conditions from 6 to\n12. Uekawa et al. [24] obtained 7–9 nm CeO2 particles\nstarting from cerium nitrate in the polyethylene glycol\nsolution. Although CeO2 particles prepared by the pre-\ncipitation technique have been extensively studied, most of\nthe previous reports were focused on effects of cerium\nprecursors,\nligands, additives and reaction media. Less\ninformation was reported on the inﬂuences of reaction\ntemperature and atmosphere. Therefore, in the present work,\n\n0272-8842/$30.00 # 2004 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Chang / Ceramics International 31 (2005) 795–802\n\nit was attempted to study the effects of reaction temperature\nand oxygen content of atmosphere on the formation of CeO2\nparticles. The particle size, morphology, shape, crystalline\nstructure and UV absorption of resulting particles were also\ndemonstrated and discussed.\n\n2. Experimental\n\nAll chemicals were reagent grade and used without\nfurther puriﬁcation. A 50 ml of aqueous cerium nitrate\n(Ce(NO3)3(cid:1)6H2O, Strem, 99.9%) solution (0.2 M) was used\nas the cerium precursor. Firstly, 25 ml of ammonia water\n(from Riedel-de Hae¨n Co.) was totally added into the cerium\nprecursor solution. The reaction was carried out at the\ndesired temperature with a stirring rate of 500 rpm. A stream\nof O2/N2 mixture was bubbled into the reactor to oxidize\nCe(III) to Ce(IV). The oxygen content of the atmosphere for\nthis study was ranged from 5% to pure oxygen, which was\nmeasured with a gas chromatograph (GC14B, Shimadzu).\nAt the beginning of reaction, a white precipitate came out in\nthe solution immediately. Subsequently,\nthe color of\nprecipitates turned into purple, and gradually became light\nyellow. The time required for completing the reaction was\n2 h. Finally, the precipitate was centrifuged, and followed by\nwashing with de-ionized water and ethanol alternatively for\nthree times.\n\nThe pH value of the reaction solution was recorded with a\npH meter (HM-20S, TOA, Japan). The morphologies of as-\nprepared CeO2 nanoparticles were observed by TEM\n(1200EX, JEOL). An appropriate amount of CeO2 suspen-\nsion was dropped onto carbon-coated copper grids for TEM\nobservation. The average particle size (dTEM) and particle\nsize distribution were determined from TEM images by\ncounting more than 100 particles. However, needle-like\nparticles were excluded from the size calculation. The\nHRTEM (3010, JEOL) with an accelerating voltage of\n300 kV was employed for larger magniﬁed observations.\nThe crystalline structure was studied by using XRD (RX-III,\nRigaku), and the crystallite size of samples, dXRD, was\nestimated by applying full-width-half-maximum (FWHM)\nof characteristic peak (1 1 1) to the Scherrer equation:\n\ndXRD ¼\n\n0:9l\nFWHM cos u\n\n(1)\n\nwhere l was the incident wavelength (1.5406 A˚\nin this\nstudy) of X-ray, and u was the diffraction angle for the\n(1 1 1) plane. The particle size of samples measured by\nnitrogen adsorption at 77 K (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics),\ndBET, was calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller\n(BET) equation with assuming that the CeO2 particles were\nspherical and non-porous [20]. The bandgap energies of\nsamples were estimated from the UV–vis absorption spectra\n(UV–vis spectrophotometer, Lambda 20, Perkin Elmer).\nThe sample loading in ethanol for the measurement was\nin range of 0.08–0.15 g/L.\n\nFig. 1.

CeO2 formation mechanism and pH evolution\n\nThe formation of CeO2 involves several complicated\nreactions [25–27]. As the ammonia water is totally added\ninto the cerium precursor solution, the Ce(OH)3 precipitate\nis formed immediately due to the extreme low solubility\nconstant\nthe Ce(OH)3\nwas oxidized to hydrated Ce(IV) ions in alkaline envi-\nronment\n[27], and then further hydrolyzed to form\n[Ce(OH)x(H2O)y](4(cid:4)x)+ complex [13,22]. Finally, the cer-\n\n[26]. Subsequently,\n\n(7 (cid:3) 10(cid:4)21)\n\nFig. 2. XRD patterns for CeO2 particles prepared at different temperatures:\n(a) 30 8C, (b) 50 8C, (c) 70 8C, and (d) 90 8C.

It is noticed\nthat the hydroxyl ions are highly involved in the whole\nprocess, which would strongly affect the supersaturation\ndegree of initial precipitate [20] and the oxidation of Ce(III)\nto Ce(IV) [22]. Therefore, the concentration of hydroxyl\nions, i.e., alternatively indicated by the pH of solution, plays\nan important role on determining the particle morphology\n[2] and the resulting suspension state [27]. Since the\nevolution of pH value indeed corresponds to the extent of\nreaction, monitoring the pH change is helpful to comprehend\nthe formation mechanism of CeO2 particles.\n\nThe variation of pH with reaction time at different\nammonia concentrations is shown in Fig. 1. As the\n\nconcentration of ammonia water is 1.2 M, the pH value\ndecreases slowly within initial 5 min and then falls down\nabruptly. The abrupt pH drop indicates that considerable\nhydroxyl ions are consumed in this stage. Zhou et al. [20]\nand Chen and Chen [22] reported, higher concentration of\nhydroxyl ions would favor the Ce(III)/Ce(IV) oxidation, and\nthe hydronium ions (H3O+) were released\nmoreover,\naccompanying with the Ce(III)/Ce(IV) oxidation and\ncausing the sharp decrease of pH. In the subsequent\nhydrolysis and deprotonation steps, hydroxyl\nions are\nsubstantially depleted at a slower rate. Even though the\nreaction time is further prolonged to 400 min, the pH value\ndecreases no more, which reveals the dissolution and\nrecrystallization of particles are performed in this stage.

Effect of reaction temperature\n\nvery good consistence with dXRD and dTEM. Therefore, the\nprepared particles are conﬁrmed to be primary and non-\nporous.\n\nFrom Fig. 3, the shape of CeO2 particles is strongly\ndependent on the reaction temperature. At 30 8C,\nthe\nprepared particles are shaped square-like, whereas they are\ntransformed into hexagonal shape at higher temperature. To\n\nThe typical XRD pattern of prepared CeO2 particles is\nshown as the inset of Fig. 2. The characteristic peaks are very\nclose to the cubic ﬂuorite structured CeO2 crystal in the\nJCPDS database. Besides, the XRD patterns in 2u ranges of\n25–358 (Fig. 2) show that samples prepared at\nlower\ntemperatures exhibit broader peaks shifting toward a little\nsmaller angles.\n\nThe TEM images of CeO2 nanoparticles prepared at 30,\n50, 70, and 90 8C (Fig. 3) demonstrate fairly uniform size\ndistributions. Moreover, the particle size increases with\nelevating the reaction temperature, inferred that the growth\nrate of particles is predominant over the nucleation rate.\nThis result is in good agreement with that reported by Wu\net al. [12]. As shown in Table 1, the average particle size\nobtained from TEM (dTEM) is quite close to the crystallite\nsize obtained from XRD patterns (dXRD). This clearly\nindicates the presence of agglomerates in CeO2 particles\ncan be neglected at various reaction temperatures. In\naddition, the BET average particle size, dBET, based on\nassumptions of non-porous and spherical particles, shows\n\nFig. 5.

One is with {1 1 1} facets which\ngrow along the diagonal direction (Fig. 4a), and the other is\nwith {1 0 0} facets which are along the edge of square (Fig.\n4b). The interplanar spacings for {1 1 1} and {1 0 0} facets\nare determined as 0.32 and 0.27 nm, respectively. As raising\nthe reaction temperature to 90 8C,\nlarger particles are\nappeared (Fig. 4c). Besides, since the {1 0 0} facets with\nhigher surface energy grow slower than {1 1 1} facets, it\nresults in the particles growing from truncated cubes to\ncubo-octahedrons, and thus the corresponding images\ntransforming from square-like to hexagonal shape [28,29].\nAlternatively, the shape evolution can also be conﬁrmed by\n\nthe XRD patterns. The intensity ratio of plane (1 1 1) to\n(2 0 0), A(1 1 1)/A(2 0 0),\nincreases with increasing the\nreaction temperature (Fig. 5). Obviously, this depicts the\noccurrence probability of plane (1 1 1) is predominant over\nthe plane (2 0 0), which is in good accordance with the\nHRTEM results and also agrees with reports of Kirk and\nWood [30].\n\n3.3.

[Ce3+]0 = 0.2 M, [NH4OH] = 3.0 M.\n\nThis equation indicates that the oxidation of Ce(III) to\nCe(IV) is strongly inﬂuenced by the oxygen content of\natmosphere. Fig. 6 shows the effect of oxygen content on the\nparticle morphology. At 5% O2 ambient,\nthe resulting\nparticles are all hexagonal. When the oxygen content\nincreases to 50%, few needles appear mixed with hexagonal\nparticles. With increasing the oxygen content, the amount of\nneedle-like particles is increased. Yamashita et al. [2]\nreported that\nthe needle-like structure was preferred to\nappear in alkaline media with the presence of hydrogen\nperoxide via topotactic mechanism [2]. Zhou et al. [26]\nproposed that the dissolved oxygen most likely caused the\nslow oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV) and thus resulted in a\nﬁner and less agglomerated particles. In other words, at\noxygen-rich ambient or by reacting with strong oxidant\nH2O2, it would beneﬁt the formation of needle-like and ﬁner\nparticles. Eventually, as listed in Table 1, the average particle\nsizes, dTEM and dXRD, consistently decrease with increasing\nthe oxygen content. However,\nthe true mechanism for\nmorphological evolution has not been fully understood.\n\n3.4. Effects of reaction temperature and atmosphere\non the lattice relaxation\n\nThe lattice relaxation accompanied with reducing the\nparticle size is of great importance and would strongly affect\nthe properties of CeO2 nanoparticles [31]. Fig. 7 illustrates\nthe dependence of lattice parameter on the crystallite size\nvarying with reaction temperature and atmosphere. As can\nbe found, the lattice parameter decreases consistently with\nincreasing the crystallite size, and is larger than 5.41 A˚ for\nbulk CeO2 crystal [32,33], regardless of changing tempera-\nture or atmosphere. Although the oxygen content of\n\natmosphere is indeed an important factor on determining\nthe size and shape of resulting particles, the variation of\nlattice parameter by oxygen content (within 0.12%) seems,\nhowever, less signiﬁcant than the variation of temperature\neffect (within 0.27%).\n\n3.5. UV absorption and bandgap energy\n\nAs previously reported [34],\n\nthe size-induced lattice\nrelaxation was usually resulted from the higher percentage\nof Ce(III) in CeO2 crystals, which would demonstrate a blue\nshift of edge absorption in UV–vis absorption spectra. Fig. 8\nshows the absorption edge obviously shifts toward shorter\nwavelength, i.e., blue shift, due to the decrease of particle\nsize by lowering the reaction temperature. The direct\nbandgap energy can be determined by extrapolating the\nabsorption coefﬁcient (a) to zero [1,17] with\nðaEphotonÞ2 ¼ CdirðEphoton (cid:4) EdirÞ\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Cdir is the absorption constant and Edir is the bandgap\nenergy for direct transition. Conventionally, the absorption\ncoefﬁcient (a) is deﬁned as [1,17]\n\na ¼\n\n2:303Absr\nLc\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Abs is the absorbance of the sample, c is the sample\nloading and the L is the path length (L = 1 cm). The density\nof CeO2, r, is taken as 7.28 g/cm3 [1]. From the plot of\n(aEphoton)2 versus Ephoton (Fig. 9), it reveals that the bandgap\ndecreases from 3.71 to 3.56 eV as the reaction temperature\nincreases from 30 to 90 8C. Furthermore, the indirect band-\ngap energy can be also determined from the inset of Fig. 9.\nSimilarily, it is found that the indirect bandgap energy\n\n\fH.-I. Chen, H.-Y.

Inset: Plot of (aEphoton)1/\n2 vs. Ephoton.\n\ndecreases from 3.08 to 2.89 eV. Comparing the estimated\nbandgap energies (Fig. 10), it clearly reveals that, due to the\nquantum size effect, either direct or indirect bandgap ener-\ngies are mostly larger than values of bulk powders (3.19 eV\nfor direct transition, and 3.01 eV for indirect transition) [1].\nIn addition, the bandgap energy increases with decreasing\nthe crystallite size by either lowering the reaction tempera-\nture or increasing the oxygen content. However, a break is\noccurred at 21–50% O2, which encounters the structure and\nshape transformations for CeO2 crystals.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nFrom the present results, the properties of prepared CeO2\nnanoparticles are strongly dependent on the reaction\ntemperature and oxygen content of O2/N2 atmosphere.\nOver the whole studied conditions, the resulting particles are\ncharacterized to be primary, non-porous and with cubic\nﬂuorite structure. The average particle size can be increased\nby either increasing the reaction temperature or decreasing\nthe oxygen content. Raising the reaction temperature from\n30 to 90 8C, the particle shape changes from square-like to\nhexagonal. Moreover,\nthe\nparticles are shaped hexagonal, whereas needles mixed\nwith hexagonal-shaped particles appeared at oxygen content\nabove 50%. The bandgap energies of prepared CeO2\nparticles can be approximately modulated by varying the\nparticle size based on the quantum conﬁnement effect,\nhowever, the oxygen-induced shape change might cause\ndeviation to some extent.\n\nin oxygen-lean atmosphere,\n\nReferences\n\n[1] S.
