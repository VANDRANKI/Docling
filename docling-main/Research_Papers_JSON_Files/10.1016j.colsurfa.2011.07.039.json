Introduction\n\nThe   dramatic   differences   in   the   effects   of   two   different   polishing   pads   (IC1000   and   Politex)   on   the\nremoval   rates   (RRs)   of   poly-Si,   SiO2,  and   Si3N4 ﬁlms   during   chemical   mechanical   polishing   using   aqueous\nabrasive-free   solutions   of   a  cationic   polymer,   poly(diallyldimethyl   ammonium   chloride)   (PDADMAC),   are\ndescribed.  For   example,   with   a  250   ppm   of  aqueous   PDADMAC   solution,   poly-Si   RR   is  <1   nm/min   with\na   Politex   pad   but   is   about   500   nm/min   using   an   IC1000   pad.   The   difference   in   the   RRs   is   attributed   to\ndifferences   in   the   strengths   of   PDADMAC-mediated   bridging   interactions   between   the   pads   and  the   sub-\nstrates.   Also,   when   the  same   250   ppm   of  PDADMAC   was   used   as  an   additive   in   either   silica-   or   ceria-based\ndispersions,   the  RRs   of   both   SiO2 and   Si3N4 ﬁlms   were   suppressed   to  less   than   1  nm/min   for  both   pads.\nPossible   mechanisms   for   the   observed   differences   in   the  RRs   of  poly-Si,   SiO2,  and   Si3N4 on   the   two   pads\nare   discussed   based   on  elemental   analysis   of   the  pads,   X-ray   photoelectron   spectroscopy,   and   zeta   poten-\ntial  measurements   (of   the   pads   in   the   absence   and   presence   of  PDADMAC).   Also,   the   results   of  exposure\nto   eosin   Y,   a   dye   that   changes   color   on  exposure   to  PDADMAC   provided   useful   insights   into   the  strength\nof   the   bridging   attraction   between   the   pads   and   PDADMAC.\n\n© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Some  of  the  more\npopular  pads  include  Suba,  Politex,  and  the  IC-series  of  pads,\nstacked  with  and  without  Suba  pads.  Politex  pads  are  made  from\nmicroporous  urethane  having  a  surface  morphology  derived  from\nthe  ends  of  columnar  void  structures  in  bulk  urethane  and  are\ngrown  on  a  urethane  felt  base  [1].   IC-series  pads  are  ﬁlled  and/or\nblown  composite  urethanes  having  surface  structures  made  up  of\nhemispherical  depressions  derived  from  exposed  hollow  spherical\nelements  or  incorporated  gas  bubbles  [1].   The  method  of  manufac-\nturing  provides  these  two  pads  with  different  intrinsic  properties\nsuch  as  chemical  composition,  speciﬁc  density,  pore  size,  surface\nroughness,  and  hardness.  The  traditional  role  of  such  polishing  pads\nhas  been  to  hold,  disperse  and  rejuvenate  the  slurry  in  the  pores,\ntransmit  the  load  to  the  abrasives  and  wafer,  and  assist  with  the\nplanarization  of  the  surface  topography  of  the  substrate  [2].   Sev-\neral  studies  [3]  revealed  distinguishable  differences  among  these\n\n∗\n\nCorresponding  author.\nE-mail  address:  babu@clarkson.edu  (S.V.

Other  studies  have  also\nfocused  on  the  differences  in  pad  glazing,  conditioning  and  soaking\nin  water,  and  chemical  or  physical  modiﬁcation  of  the  pad  surfaces\n[6,7].\n\nIn  view  of  these  differences,  Politex  and  IC1000  pads  have  been\nused  for  different  applications  in  the  semiconductor  industry.  For\nexample,  Politex  pads  are  widely  used  for  removing  tungsten,  tan-\ntalum,  and  tantalum  nitride  and  for  various  bufﬁng  steps,  while\nIC1000  pads  are  used  to  produce  high  planarization  efﬁciencies  [8].\nThese  pads  are  also  used  during  the  polishing  and  planarization\nof  three  dielectric  ﬁlms  (poly-Si,  SiO2 and  Si3N4)  that  are  important\nand  challenging  during  the  fabrication  of  recently  developed  Fin\nField-effect-transistor  (FinFET)  devices  [9,10],   in  the  replacement\nmetal  gate  (RMG)  technique  for  the  fabrication  of  high-k/metal  gate\nstructures  [11],  in  creating  shallow  trench  isolation  (STI)  structures\n[10],  and  in  the  processing  of  microelectromechanical  systems\n(MEMS)  [12].  In  this  paper,  we  extend  our  recent  work  [13]  in  which\naqueous  solutions  of  a  cationic  polymer,  poly(diallyldimethyl\nammonium  chloride)  (PDADMAC),  were  shown  to  polish  poly-Si\nat  a  rate  of  about  500  nm/min  at  pH  10  using  an  IC1000  pad.

Part  a  is  from  Ref.  [13].\n\ndifferent  when  the  softer  Politex  pads  are  used.  The  RRs  of  poly-Si,\nSiO2,  and  Si3N4 ﬁlms  obtained  using  aqueous  abrasive-free  solu-\ntions  and  ceria  and  silica  dispersions,  with  and  without  250  ppm\nPDADMAC,  were  reported  earlier  but  only  for  an  IC1000  pad  [13],\nand  are  again  presented  (Figs.  1a,  2a  and  3a)  for  ease  of  comparison\nwith  the  new  data  reported  here.\n\n∼\n\nThe  experiments  described  herein  show  that,  using  250  ppm\nof  an  abrasive-free  aqueous  solution  of  a  cationic  polymer,  PDAD-\nMAC   (MW  \n  200,000  g/mol),  the  RRs  of  poly-Si  can  be  suppressed\nto  <1  nm/min  on  a  Politex  pad  at  all  pH  values  tested  in  the  range\nof  2–10  (Fig.  1b)  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  RRs  increasing  from\n∼500  nm/min  as  the  pH  is  increased  from  2  to\n∼200  nm/min  to \n10  with  the  IC1000  pad  (Fig.  1a)  [13].  On  adding  either  1  wt%   silica\nor  ceria  abrasives  to  250  ppm  of  aqueous  PDADMAC  solutions,  the\npoly-Si  RRs  on  the  Politex  pad  were  enhanced  somewhat,  but  only\nfor  pH  >  4  and  still  considerably  lower  than  those  on  an  IC1000  pad,\nwhile  the  RRs  of  both  the  SiO2 and  Si3N4 ﬁlms  were  suppressed\nto  <1  nm/min  on  both  the  pads.  In  the  following,  these  RRs  are\ndescribed  in  detail  along  with  the  results  of  several  other  mea-\nsurements  performed  to  explain  them.  In  contrast  to  the  results\nof  Chen  and  Yen  [14],  who  showed  that  the  hardness  of  the  pads\nand  the  abrasives  and  the  electrostatic  interactions  affect  the  RRs  of\npoly(silsesquioxane),  our  analysis  suggests  that  the  strength  of  the\nbridging  attraction  between  the  pad,  wafer  surface  and  PDADMAC\nmolecules  is  the  dominant  factor  in  determining  the  RRs  reported\nhere.\n\n2.  Experimental\n\n2.1.  Materials\n\nAn  aqueous  dispersion  of  ceria  abrasives  (dmean ∼\n\n  180  nm,\n50  wt%)  was   supplied  by  Ferro  Corp.  The  same  dispersion  was\nused  in  several  of  our  earlier  publications  [15,16],   and  its  char-\nacteristics  are  available  there.  Colloidal  silica  abrasives  (NexSil\n85A,  dmean ∼\n  50  nm),  stabilized  at  pH  3.5,  were  supplied  by\nNyacol  Nano  Technologies.  Silicon  nitride  particles,  PDADMAC\n(MW  ∼  200,000  g/mol),  and  the  pH  adjusting  agents  (KOH  and\nHNO3)  were  all  obtained  from  Sigma–Aldrich.  Eosin  Y  dye  was  pur-\nchased  from  Alfa  Aesar.  The  two   types  of  polishing  pads  (IC1000\nK-groove  and  Politex)  and  the  diamond  grit  conditioner  used  here\nwere  supplied  by  Dow  Electronic  Materials  and  3M,   respectively.\nBlanket  poly-Si  ﬁlms  (2000  nm  thick,  low  pressure  chemical  vapor\ndeposited  (LPCVD)  at  about  610 ◦C  on  silicon  wafers)  were  obtained\nfrom  DK  Nanotechnology.  Thermal  oxide  (2000  nm  thick,  grown  at\n900 ◦C)  and  silicon  nitride  ﬁlms  (500  nm  thick,  LPCVD  at  790 ◦C)\ngrown  on  silicon  substrates  were  obtained  from  Montco-Silicon\nTechnologies,  Inc.  While  the  poly-Si  and  silicon  nitride  ﬁlms  were\ndeposited  on  an  intervening  100  nm  thick  silicon  dioxide  layer\ngrown  on  8  in.  diameter  silicon  wafers,  the  thermal  oxide  was\ndirectly  grown  on  the  silicon  substrate.

Part  a  is  from  Ref.  [13].\n\n2.2.  Methods\n\n2.2.1.  Determination  of  RRs\n\nThe  2  in.  diameter  wafers  were  polished  for  one  minute  on\na  CETR  polisher  at  4  psi  down  pressure,  90/90  rpm  carrier/platen\nspeed,  and  a  slurry  ﬂow  rate  of  120  ml/min.  The  IC1000  pad  (k-\ngroove)  was  conditioned  for  one  minute  using  a  4  in.  diameter\ndiamond-grit  conditioner  after  each  polishing  but  no  conditioning\nwas  performed  for  the  Politex  pad.  A  Filmetrics  interferometer  was\nused  to  measure  the  thickness  of  the  different  ﬁlms  (oxide,  Si3N4,\nand  poly-Si)  before  and  after  polishing.  The  RR  of  each  of  these\nﬁlms  was  determined  from  the  difference  between  pre-  and  post-\npolished  ﬁlm  thickness  values.  The  reported  RR  for  each  experiment\nis  the  arithmetic  average  of  the  RRs  measured  for  two   different\nwafers,  each  at  16  points  located  across  a  diameter  of  the  wafer.\nThe  standard  deviation  in  RRs  was  based  on  the  data  for  these  32\npoints.\n\n2.2.2.  Surface  characterization  of  polishing  pads\n2.2.2.1.  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS).  Chemical  composi-\ntions  of  the  surfaces  of  a  conditioned  IC1000  and  un-conditioned\nPolitex  pads  were  determined  using  XPS.  Survey  scans  and  high  res-\nolution  C  1s  XPS  were  acquired  using  Surface  Science  Instruments\nmodel  SSX-100  spectrometer  (Eastman  Kodak,  Rochester,  NY).  A\nmonochromatic  Al  K(cid:2)\n  X-ray  source  at  1486.6  eV  was   used.  Photo-\nelectrons  were  collected  at  an  angle  of  55◦ from  the  surface  normal\nand  analyzed  using  a  hemispherical  analyzer  with  a  pass  energy  of\n150  eV  for  survey  scans  and  50  eV  for  high  resolution  scans.  Charge\n\ncompensation  was   carried  out  using  low-energy  electrons  from  an\nelectron  ﬂood  gun.  The  spectra  were  analyzed  using  the  CasaXPS\nsoftware.  These  experiments  were  performed  at  Cornell  Center  for\nMaterials  Research.\n\n2.2.2.2.  Zeta  potential  measurements.  A  ZetaSpin  1.2  apparatus\n(Zetametrix,  Inc.,  USA)  was   used  to  determine  the  zeta  potentials\nof  both  IC1000  and  Politex  pad  surfaces.  These  measurements  were\nconducted  in  a  0.001  M  aqueous  solution  of  KCl,  with  and  without\nthe  addition  of  PDADMAC.  The  zeta  potentials  were  calculated  from\nthe  streaming  potentials  measured  in  the  vicinity  of  a  rotating  disk\nto  which  the  polishing  pad  sample  was   attached.  Ideally,  samples\nwith  a  ﬂat  surface  are  necessary  for  the  conversion  of  streaming\npotentials  to  zeta  potential  values.  Hence,  a  1  in.  diameter  sample  of\nthe  IC1000  pad  was   obtained  from  the  center  of  the  pad,  where  the\nsurface  texture  was  smooth.  The  surface  of  the  Politex  pad  sample\nwas  smoothed  using  a  sharp  diamond-coated  knife  edge.\n\n2.2.3.  Bulk  compositions  of  pads\n\nFT-IR  spectroscopy  and  elemental  analysis  of  the  solids  col-\nlected  by  scraping  the  IC1000  and  Politex  pad  surfaces  were\nperformed  at  QTI,  Whitehouse,  NJ.  The  IR  spectra  were  acquired  in\nthe  reﬂectance  mode.  C,  H,  and  N  compositions  were  determined\nusing  a  PerkinElmer  2400  Elemental  Analyzer,  wherein  these  ele-\nments  are  converted  to  the  gases,  CO2,  H2O,  and  N2,  respectively,\nby  combustion  in  pure  oxygen.  Thermal  conductivity  measure-\nments  are  then  used  to  obtain  the  molar  amounts  of  these  gases.\nThe  Oxygen  Accessory  Kit  was   used  to  determine  O  in  the  sample,\nusing  pyrolysis  to  convert  O  to  CO  followed  by  thermal  conductivity\ndetection  of  CO.  A  colorimetric  titration  assay  was  used  to  deter-\nmine  Cl  in  the  samples.  Combustion  of  the  sample  in  an  oxygen\ncombustion  ﬂask  in  the  presence  of  H2O2 resulted  in  the  forma-\ntion  of  chloride,  which  was   titrated  with  mercuric  nitrate  in  the\npresence  of  phenylazoformic  acid  2-phenylhydrazide.\n\n3.  Results  and  discussion\n\n3.1.  Polishing  results\n\nPoly-Si  RRs:  Fig.  1  shows  the  poly-Si  RRs  obtained  on  an  IC1000\nand  a  Politex  pad,  in  the  pH  range  of  2–10  using  pH-adjusted  deion-\nized  (DI)  water,  aqueous  solutions  of  250  ppm  of  PDADMAC,  and\n1  wt%  ceria/silica  suspensions  with  250  ppm  PDADMAC  and  with-\nout  PDADMAC.  A  PDADMAC  concentration  of  250  ppm  was  chosen\nfor  all  our  experiments  since  the  RRs  of  poly-Si  obtained  were  high\nat  this  concentration  [13].\n\nThe  poly-Si  RRs  are  generally  lower  on  a  Politex  pad  compared  to\nthe  RRs  with  the  IC1000  pad  in  all  these  cases  (Fig.  1b).  More  signif-\nicantly,  with  the  Politex  pad,  no  poly-Si  RRs  were  observed  using\nabrasive-free  solutions  of  250  ppm  of  PDADMAC  in  the  pH  range\nof  2–10.  Adding  either  1  wt%  ceria  or  silica  abrasives  enhanced  the\nRRs  somewhat,  especially  above  pH  4,  but  they  are  still  much  lower\nthan  those  with  the  IC1000  pad.\n\nSiO2 and  Si3N4 RRs:  Unlike  the  poly-Si  RRs,  the  oxide  and\n∼0  nm/min  when  polished  using\nnitride  RRs  on  both  the  pads  were \npH-adjusted  DI  water  as  well  as  250  ppm  of  aqueous  PDADMAC\nsolutions  in  the  pH  range  of  2–10.  These  data  are  not  shown.\n\nFig.  2  shows  the  RRs  of  the  oxide  and  nitride  ﬁlms  using  an\nIC1000  pad  and  a  Politex  pad  with  1  wt%  ceria  (dmean ∼\n  180  nm)\ndispersions  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  PDADMAC  (250  ppm\nconcentration).  Using  1  wt%   ceria  with  no  PDADMAC  and  with\nthe  IC1000  pad,  the  oxide  RR  is  about  10  nm/min  at  pH  2,  about\n180  nm/min  at  pH  3  and  greater  than  400  nm/min  in  the  pH  range\nof  4–10  while  the  nitride  RR  is  less  than  10  nm/min  below  pH  4\nand  about  100  nm/min  in  the  pH  range  of  4–10.  With  the  Politex\npad,  the  sharp  increase  in  the  oxide  RRs  (which  was  observed  at\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f24\n\nN.K.

In  the  pH  range  5–8,  the  oxide  RRs  on  the  Politex\npad  are  very  similar  to  those  on  the  IC1000  pad.  However,  beyond\npH  8,  the  oxide  RR  decreased  sharply  for  the  Politex  pad,  while  only\na  smaller  decrease  was  observed  with  the  IC1000  pad.  The  differ-\nences  in  the  nitride  RRs  in  the  pH  range  of  2–10  were  negligible  for\nthe  two  pads  investigated.\n\nSigniﬁcantly,  the  addition  of  250  ppm  of  PDADMAC  to  the  ceria\ndispersion  led  to  a  suppression  of  the  oxide  and  nitride  RRs  to  below\n1  nm/min  on  both  the  pads  (Fig.  2).  Before  proceeding  further,  we\nwould  like  to  point  out  that  the  enhancement  of  poly-Si  RR  on  the\nIC1000  pad  using  250  ppm  PDADMAC  in  the  absence  or  presence  of\nceria  or  silica,  and  the  simultaneous  suppression  of  both  the  oxide\nand  nitride  RRs  is  very  useful  in  the  fabrication  of  FinFET  and  MEMS\ndevices.  On  the  other  hand,  the  suppression  of  poly-Si  RRs  on  the\nPolitex  pad  using  aqueous  solutions  of  the  same  polymer  can  be\nuseful  for  the  RMG   CMP   applications  provided  higher  oxide  and/or\nnitride  RRs  can  be  maintained  with  suitable  additives.  Indeed,  this\nis  possible  and  will  be  discussed  in  a  separate  publication.\n\nFig.  3  compares  the  RRs  of  both  oxide  and  nitride  ﬁlms  on  IC1000\nand  Politex  pads  using  1  wt%  silica  (dmean ∼\n  50  nm)  dispersions  with\nand  without  250  ppm  PDADMAC.  Using  1  wt%  silica  with  no  addi-\n∼15  nm/min  at  pH  2  and\ntive  and  IC1000  pad,  the  oxide  RR  is \ndecreased  to  <1  nm/min  as  the  pH  was  increased  above  3.  A  similar\noxide  RR  trend  (lower  at  pH  2  and  3)  was  observed  on  the  Politex\npad.  In  the  case  of  nitride  ﬁlms,  the  RRs  on  the  IC1000  pad  are  about\n40  nm/min  at  pH  2  to  3  and  then  decreased  above  pH  3,  reaching\n<1  nm/min  for  pH \n  5.  With  the  Politex  pad  also,  the  same  big  drop\nin  the  nitride  RR  occurred,  but  now  beyond  pH  4  and  again  reaching\n<1  nm/min  for  pH \n\n  6.\n\n≥\n\n≥\n\nAdding  250  ppm  of  PDADMAC  to  1  wt%  silica  dispersions  sup-\npressed  both  the  oxide  and  nitride  RRs  to  <1  nm/min  on  both  the\npads  over  the  entire  pH  range  just  as  with  ceria  dispersions.  Before\nproceeding  further,  it  should  be  noted  that  using  the  Politex  pad\nat  pH  3  or  4,  the  1  wt%  silica  based  slurries  without  any  additive\nproduced  comparatively  high  nitride  RR  (about  50  nm/min)  and\nvery  low  oxide  and  poly-Si  RRs  (both  below  1  nm/min).  Hence,  this\npad-slurry  combination  is  potentially  attractive  for  reverse  STI  and\nRMG   applications  when  high  nitride  and  low  oxide/poly-Si  RRs  are\nrequired.\n\nChen  and  Yen  [14]  compared  the  relative  performance  of  an\nIC1400  hard  pad  with  a  Politex  soft  pad  on  the  CMP  of  low-k\npoly(silsesquioxane)  ﬁlms.  They  found  that  the  hardness  of  the\nabrasives  and  the  pads  and  the  electrostatic  interaction  between\nthe  abrasive  and  polymer  surface  strongly  affected  the  RRs.  Our  pol-\nishing  results  above  suggest  that  the  RRs  of  oxide  and  nitride  ﬁlms\non  the  hard  IC1000  pads  and  the  soft  Politex  pads  were  relatively\nthe  same  when  either  ceria  or  silica  abrasives  were  used,  except\nat  speciﬁc  pH  values.  Hence,  the  hardness  of  the  pads  or  the  abra-\nsives  alone  cannot  explain  the  difference  in  the  observed  dramatic\ndrop  in  the  poly-Si  RRs.  In  order  to  examine  the  role  of  possible\ndifferences  in  the  intermolecular  forces  of  interactions  between\nthe  pad/abrasive/substrate  surfaces,  the  chemical  composition  of\nthe  pads  (particularly  their  surface  compositions)  were  probed  in\ndetail  using  FT-IR  spectroscopy,  elemental  analysis,  and  X-ray  pho-\ntoelectron  spectroscopy  in  these  studies.  The  results  are  described\nbelow.\n\n3.2.  Infrared  spectroscopy\n\nBoth  pads  showed  a  peak  at  814  cm−1,  corresponding  to  the  C–H\ndeformation  of  the  aromatic  rings  (from  the  hard  segment  of  the\npolymer).  For  comparison  of  chemical  composition  of  the  two  pads,\nthe  IR  spectra  were  normalized  such  that  the  absorbances  are  the\nsame  for  this  peak.  The  peaks  observed  at  1600  cm−1 correspond\nto  the  C  C  stretching  vibrations  of  the  aromatic  rings  (spectra  not\n\nTable  1\nSurface  compositions  of  IC1000  and  Politex  pads  determined  using  XPS.\n\nIC1000 \n\nAtomic  % \n\nNo.  of  atoms\nrelative  to  C  (%)\n\nC \nN\nO\nCl\nSi  \n\n64.9 \n6.1  \n22.0  \n3.3 \n3.7 \n\n100 \n9\n34 \n5 \n6 \n\nPolitex\n\nAtomic  % \n\n75.5 \n0.8 \n22.4 \n0.8 \n0.5 \n\nNo.  of  atoms\nrelative  to  C  (%)\n\n100\n1\n30\n1\n<1\n\nshown).  The  absorbances  of  these  peaks  were  nearly  the  same  for\nthe  two  pads,  as  expected.  The  peak  at  1101  cm−1 corresponds  to\nthe  C–O  stretch  of  the  polyether  soft  segments  in  the  polyurethane.\nThe  absorbance  of  this  peak  was   higher  in  the  case  of  the  Politex\npad,  which  is  consistent  with  the  soft  nature  of  this  pad.\n\nThe  C O  stretching  vibrations  of  the  urethane  groups  (amide  I\nbands)  were  seen  at  1713  cm−1 in  IC1000  and  1729  cm−1 in  Poli-\ntex.  The  peaks  at  1521  cm−1 and  1533  cm−1 are  also  attributed  to\nthe  urethane  groups  (amide  II  bands).  The  higher  intensity  of  the\namide  II  band  in  IC1000  indicates  the  presence  of  a  large  number\nof  urethane  groups  in  this  pad  (which  is  again  in  agreement  with\nthe  higher  hardness  of  IC1000).\n\n3.3.  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy\n\nThe  surface  compositions  of  the  pads  were  determined  using  X-\nray  photoelectron  spectroscopy,  using  an  electron  emission  angle\nof  55◦.  At  this  angle,  the  XPS  probe  depth  is  estimated  to  be  about\n3.5  nm.   The  XPS  survey  scan  for  the  IC1000  pad  is  shown  in  Fig.  4\nand  the  compositions  of  different  elements  present  at  the  surfaces\nof  the  two  pads  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  Atom  compositions\nwere  calculated  using  the  area  of  the  peaks,  Scoﬁeld  photoioniza-\ntion  cross  section,  and  assuming  0.7th  power  dependence  of  the\nsampling  depth  on  kinetic  energy  of  photoelectrons.\n\nThe  surface  concentration  of  N  in  IC1000  is  higher  than  that  in\nPolitex,  evidently  from  a  larger  number  of  urethane  (–OC(  O)NH–)\nand  urea  (–NHC(  O)NH–)  linkages  in  the  IC1000  pad,  which  makes\nit  harder.  The  surface  concentration  of  Cl  was   also  found  to  be  higher\nin  the  IC1000  pad  than  in  Politex.  This  Cl  could  be  introduced  into\npolyurethane  through  the  use  of  chlorinated  polyols  [18]  or  by\ntreating  the  polyurethane  with  NaOCl  solutions  [17].  Other  stud-\nies  have  similarly  detected  Cl  in  the  IC1000  pad  using  XPS  and  EDS\n[19–21].  Si  was  detected  at  the  surfaces  of  both  the  pads.  Rams-\ndell  et  al.  [19]  have  also  found  the  presence  of  Si  at  the  surface  of\nIC1000.

Bulk  compo-\nsition  (data  not  shown)  of  Cl  was,  in  fact,  higher  in  the  Politex  pad\nthan  in  IC1000  pad  (0.1  vs  0.03  atomic  ratio,  normalized  based  on\ncarbon  atoms).  Migration  of  the  polar  (high  surface  energy)  C–Cl\ngroups  into  the  interior  of  the  pad  is  more  likely  in  the  case  of  the\nsofter  Politex  pad  than  in  the  harder  IC1000  pad.  Hence,  the  surface\nconcentration  of  Cl  is  lower  in  Politex  than  in  IC1000.\n\nFig.  5a  shows  the  area  normalized  high  resolution  C  1s  XPS  spec-\ntra  of  the  two  pads.  The  spectra  were  resolved  into  sub-peaks  using\na  series  of  Gaussian-Lorentzian  curves  and  a  Tougaard  background\n(cf.  Fig.  5b  and  c).  The  peak  assignments  and  the  relative  areas\n(number  fractions  of  carbon  atoms  of  a  particular  type)  in  the  two\npads  are  summarized  in  Table  2  below.

The  surface  of\nIC1000  also  contains  more  of  the  ester  [7],   amide,  and  urea  linkages\nthat  are  prone  to  hydrolysis  [22].\n\n3.4.  PDADMAC  binding  differences  between  IC1000  pad  and\nPolitex  pad\n\nBased  on  XPS  analysis  of  the  surfaces  of  the  pads,  differences\nin  the  extent  and  strength  of  adsorption  of  PDADMAC  can  be\nattributed  to  the  presence  of  different  amounts  of  hydrolyzable\ngroups  at  the  surfaces  of  the  two  pads.  Note  that  the  ester  and  amide\ngroups  are  readily  prone  to  hydrolysis  [22–24].   Lu  et  al.  [7]  have  also\ndiscussed  the  hydrolysis  of  C(  O)–O–C  in  polyurethane  pads.  The\nformation  of  carboxylate  ions  due  to  hydrolysis  could  be  a  reason\nfor  the  negative  charges  on  the  pad  surfaces.  Because  the  surface\nconcentrations  of  the  hydrolysable  groups  are  higher  in  the  IC1000\npad  (cf.  Table  2),  the  anion  density  and  the  extent  and  the  strength\nof  PDADMAC  adsorption  is  expected  to  be  higher  for  IC1000  than\nPolitex.\n\n3.5.  Zeta  potential  data  of  the  pads\n\nFig.  6  shows  the  zeta  potential  data  of  both  pads  in  the  absence\nand  presence  of  250  ppm  PDADMAC.  Other  researchers  have  deter-\nmined  the  zeta  potentials  of  the  IC1000  and  Politex  pads  [25,26],\nbut  the  inﬂuence  of  PDADMAC  polymer  on  the  pad  surface  charge\nhas  not  been  reported.  In  the  absence  of  any  additive,  the  IEP  of\nIC1000  pad  is  about  3.2  while  that  of  the  Politex  pad  is  higher  (about\n4.2).  These  results  are  in  agreement  with  a  recent  study  by  Sides\net  al.  [26]  who   also  measured  the  zeta  potentials  of  both  IC1000\nand  Politex  pads  using  ZetaSpin  and  observed  that  the  IEP  of  the  ﬂat\nPolitex  pad  (about  4)  is  higher  than  that  of  the  IC1000  pad  (about  3).\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f26\n\nN.K.

Zp  data  of  IC1000  and  Politex  pads  in  the  presence  of  0.001  M  KCl  electrolyte\nsolutions  with  and  without  250  ppm  PDADMAC.\n\nThey  also  noticed  lower  negative  zeta  potentials  on  a  customized\nﬂat  Politex  pad  than  those  on  the  original  grooved  pad,  suggest-\ning  that  creating  a  ﬂat  surface  is  critical  for  accurate  zeta  potential\nmeasurements.\n\nUpon  the  addition  of  PDADMAC  (250  ppm),  the  pads  became\npositively  charged  over  the  entire  pH  range  of  the  experiment\n(2.5–10.5),  evidently  due  to  adsorption  of  the  cationic  polymer  on\nthe  pad  surfaces.  The  zeta  potential  of  the  Politex  pad,  which  was\ninitially  immersed  and  stirred  in  a  PDADMAC  solution  at  pH  10,\nmeasured  in  the  presence  of  only  0.001  M  KCl  solution  is  also  pos-\nitive,  similar  to  that  measured  in  the  presence  of  the  PDADMAC\nsolution.  These  zeta  potential  results  seem  to  indicate  that  the  con-\ncentration  of  adsorbed  PDADMAC  is  higher  on  the  Politex  surface\nthan  on  the  IC1000  surface.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the\nhigher  zeta  potential  values  for  Politex  +  PDADMAC  could  simply  be\nan  artifact  of  the  textured  surface  of  the  Politex  pad  (which  is  not\naccounted  for  when  the  streaming  potential  values  are  converted\nto  zeta  potentials),  in  spite  of  our  efforts  to  smoothen  it.  Also,  the\nelemental  composition  and  XPS  data  analysis  discussed  above  sug-\ngest  that  PDADMAC  is  weakly  bound  to  the  Politex  pad,  conﬁrmed\nby  the  dye  staining  results  described  below.\n\n3.6.  Qualitative  study  of  polymer  adsorption  on  polishing  pads\n\nEosin  Y  (2(cid:6),4(cid:6),5(cid:6),7(cid:6)-tetrabromoﬂuorescein)  is  used  extensively\nfor  staining  of  proteins  and  estimating  their  concentrations  [27].\nThe  carboxylate  group  of  the  dye  binds  to  the  cationic  groups  in\namino-acid  residues  such  as  lysine,  arginine,  histidine  and  tryp-\ntophan  to  form  a  protein–dye  complex  [28].  The  formation  of  the\nprotein–dye  complex  is  easily  and  visually  recognized  by  a  change\nin  the  color  of  the  solution  from  yellow  to  pink  [27,28].\n\nSince  PDADMAC  is  a  positively  charged  cationic  polymer  and\nconsists  of  hydrophobic  sites,  it  can  also  bind  with  eosin  Y.  Indeed,\nas  shown  in  Fig.  7,  the  yellow  color  of  an  aqueous  solution  of  5  ppm\neosin  Y  changed  to  pink  on  adding  only  2  ppm  of  PDADMAC,  indi-\ncating  the  formation  of  a  polymer–dye  complex.  In  contrast,  when\npieces  of  the  two   pads,  Politex  and  IC1000,  were  each  dipped  in  an\naqueous  solution  containing  5  ppm  of  the  dye,  there  was   neither  a\nchange  in  the  color  of  the  pad  nor  in  the  UV–vis  absorption  (graphs\nnot  shown)  of  the  dye  solution,  suggesting  that  the  dye  does  not\nbind  to  either  of  the  pads.\n\nHowever,  when  pieces  of  the  two  pads  were  ﬁrst  dipped  in  an\naqueous  solution  of  250  ppm  of  PDADMAC  at  pH  10,  dried,  and  then\nimmersed  in  5  ppm  of  eosin  Y  solution,  the  solution  in  which  Poli-\ntex  pad  was  dipped  turned  pink  suggesting  the  release  of  PDADMAC\nfrom  the  pad  into  the  dye  solution.  In  contrast,  the  color  of  the  solu-\ntion  in  which  IC1000  pad  was  dipped  remained  yellow.  Moreover,\n\nFig.  7.  Experiments  to  compare  the  extents  of  PDADMAC  adsorption  on  IC1000  and\nPolitex  pads,  using  formation  of  a  colored  complex  with  eosin  Y  dye.\n\nwhen  the  IC1000  pad  was   taken  out,  the  surface  appeared  pink,\nsuggesting  that  PDADMAC  was   indeed  present  on  the  IC1000  pad\nand  remained  bound  to  it.  With  the  Politex  pad,  it  was   not  possible\nto  determine  if  there  was  any  effect  on  the  color  of  the  pad  since\nthe  pad  is  dark.  Hence,  it  could  not  be  determined  from  this  simple\nexperiment  if  all  the  PDADMAC  was  released  from  the  Politex  pad.\nSimilar  results  were  obtained  when  the  entire  set  of  experiments\nwas  repeated  at  pH  4.\n\nFurther  experiments  were  conducted  to  conﬁrm  the  higher\nadsorption  and  stronger  binding  of  PDADMAC  on  IC1000  than  on\nPolitex.  UV–vis  spectra  of  solutions  containing  eosin  Y  (5  ppm)  and\ndifferent  concentrations  of  the  polymer,  were  acquired  at  a  solution\npH  of  10.  In  the  absence  of  the  polymer,  the  dye  exhibits  an  absorp-\ntion  peak  centered  at  516  nm  (spectrum  a  in  Fig.  8).  Fig.  8  shows\nthe  effect  of  the  concentration  of  added  PDADMAC  on  the  inten-\nsity  of  this  peak  (spectra  c–e).  The  absorption  peak  shifts  to  about\n525  nm,   and  a  shoulder  appears  near  495  nm.   The  new  peak  and  the\nshoulder  can  both  be  associated  with  the  polymer–dye  complex  as\nsuggested  by  Hong  et  al.  [28]  for  protein–dye  complexes.\n\nNext,  a  Politex  pad  was   dipped  in  an  aqueous  solution  of  PDAD-\nMAC   (250  ppm,  pH  10),  and  dried.  This  pad  was   then  immersed\nin  the  dye  solution  (5  ppm  eosin  Y,  pH  10)  and  removed.  UV–vis\nspectrum  of  the  dye  solution  showed  that  the  maximum  in  the\nabsorbance  was  at  524  nm,   corresponding  to  polymer–dye  complex\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\ne\nc\nn\na\nb\nr\no\ns\nb\nA\n\n0\n\n450\n\na\n\nb\nc\n\nd\n\ne\nf\n\n470\n\n490\n\n510\n\n530\n\n550\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\nFig.  8.

Hence,  PDADMAC  was  only  weakly  adsorbed\non  Politex,  and  was  released  from  the  pad  surface  when  the  pad\nwas  immersed  in  the  solution  of  the  dye.\n\nWhen  this  procedure  was  repeated  for  the  IC1000  pad,  the\nabsorbance  maximum  of  the  dye  solution  remained  at  516  nm  (cor-\nresponding  to  the  pure  dye)  (Fig.  8,  spectrum  b),  but  with  a  slight\ndecrease  in  the  peak  height,  suggesting  that  some  of  the  dye  was\nconsumed  in  formation  of  the  polymer–dye  complex  on  the  pad\nsurface.\n\nThese  results  indicate  that  PDADMAC  adsorbs  and  is  strongly\nbound  to  IC1000  pad,  and  that  it  also  adsorbs  on  the  Politex  pad\n(also  suggested  by  the  zeta  potential  measurements,  cf.  Fig.  6)  but\nis  easily  removed  from  it,  indicating  a  much  weaker  binding  than\nthat  in  the  case  of  the  IC1000  pad.\n\n4.  Polishing  mechanisms\n\n4.1.  Poly-Si  removal  mechanism  in  the  presence  of  PDADMAC\nsolutions\n\nRecently,  using  zeta  potential  measurements,  we   suggested  that\nPDADMAC  binds  to  the  poly-Si  surface  and  to  the  IC1000  pad,\nresulting  in  polyelectrolyte  bridging  of  the  two  surfaces  [13].  Based\non  the  measured  poly-Si  RRs,  we  hypothesized  that  the  bridg-\ning  interaction  is  stronger  than  the  polarized  and  weakened  Si–Si\nbonds  of  the  poly-Si  surface.  These  weaker  bonds  are  ruptured  dur-\ning  polishing,  resulting  in  material  removal  [29].  Earlier,  Salmi  et  al.\n[30]  also  noticed  a  strong  PDADMAC-mediated  bridging  interac-\ntion  between  two  cellulosic  surfaces,  characterized  by  the  pull-off\nforces  determined  using  atomic  force  microscope.  Several  others\n[31]  have  extensively  discussed  the  bridging  attraction  between\ntwo  solid  surfaces  with  different  charge  densities  in  the  presence\nof  a  polyelectrolyte.\n\nZeta  potential  measurements  indicate  that  PDADMAC  adsorbs\nnot  only  on  IC1000,  but  also  on  Politex  (Fig.  6).  However,  the  XPS\ndata  (Table  3)  and  eosin  complexation  experiments  (Fig.  8)  indi-\ncate  that  PDADMAC  binds  with  Politex  pad  only  weakly,  and  is\neasily  solubilized  by  just  dipping  in  the  dye  solution.  The  weaker\nbonds  between  the  polymer  and  the  Politex  pad  are  easily  bro-\nken  during  polishing,  which  is  reﬂected  in  the  low  poly-Si  RRs\nobtained  using  this  pad.  It  will  be  useful  to  measure  directly  the\nstrength  of  the  bridging  forces  between  PDADMAC  molecules,  the\ntwo  pads  and  the  oxide,  nitride,  and  poly-Si  surfaces.  However,\nsuch  measurements  are  complex  and  lie  outside  the  scope  of  this\npaper.\n\n4.2.  Effect  of  PDADMAC-ceria  and  PDADMAC-silica  interaction  on\npoly-Si  RRs\n\nBased  on  zeta  potential  and  thermogravimetry,  it  was  suggested\nearlier  [13]  that  PDADMAC  binds  strongly  with  silica  abrasives\nbut  only  weakly  with  ceria  abrasives.  Since  PDADMAC-mediated\nbridging  interactions  between  silica  and  IC1000  are  stronger  than\nthose  between  ceria  and  IC1000,  an  addition  of  silica,  but  not  ceria,\nenhances  poly-Si  RR  [13].  With  the  Politex  pad,  however,  there\nis  no  enhancement  in  poly-Si  RRs,  regardless  of  whether  silica  or\nceria  abrasive  is  used,  because  PDADMAC  adsorbs  only  weakly  on\nPolitex.\n\n4.3.  Oxide  and  nitride  removal  mechanism  in  presence  of\nPDADMAC  solutions\n\nPreviously,  we  also  suggested  that  even  though  PDADMAC\nforms  a  strong  bond  between  the  IC1000  pad  and  oxide  or  nitride\nsurfaces,  the  adhesive  strength  of  the  polymer  on  oxide  and  nitride\n\nis  weaker  than  the  cohesive  strength  of  the  oxide  and  nitride  sub-\nstrates  [13].  Hence,  during  polishing,  the  polymer–substrate  bond\nis  broken  easily,  resulting  in  no  material  removal.  Based  on  the\nRRs,  it  appears  that  the  same  explanation  applies  to  polishing  with\nPolitex  pads  also.\n\n4.4.  Oxide  and  nitride  removal  mechanisms  using  ceria  and  silica\nslurries  without  PDADMAC\n\nFrom  Fig.  2,  it  is  seen  that  the  oxide  RRs  obtained  using  ceria\nslurry  at  pH  3  differ  signiﬁcantly  for  the  IC1000  and  Politex  pads.\nSimilarly,  a  large  difference  in  the  RRs  is  observed  at  pH  4.  These\npH  values  correspond  to  the  isoelectric  points  of  IC1000  and  Poli-\ntex,  respectively.  Hence,  when  the  pad  is  changed  from  IC1000  to\nPolitex,  there  is  a  change  from  electrostatic  repulsion  to  attraction\nbetween  the  ceria  abrasives  and  the  pad  in  this  pH  interval.  Appar-\nently,  this  is  sufﬁcient  to  inﬂuence  the  RRs.  Similarly,  the  observed\ndecreases  in  the  oxide  RR  beyond  the  IEP  of  ceria  (about  8)  for  both\nthe  pads  can  be  due  to  the  shift  in  the  nature  of  the  electrostatic\ninteractions  between  the  ceria  and  the  pads  surfaces,  from  attrac-\ntive  to  repulsive.  In  the  case  of  nitride  ﬁlms,  the  RRs  obtained  using\nthe  two  pads  are  not  signiﬁcantly  different  throughout  the  experi-\nmental  pH  range,  presumably  because  the  nitride  hydrolysis  is  the\nrate  controlling  step  in  the  removal  mechanism  [32,33].\n\nSimilar  changes  seen  in  the  nitride  RR  at  pH  4  obtained  with\nsilica  slurry  when  the  pad  was  changed  from  IC1000  to  Politex  pad\ncan  also  be  a  result  of  the  change  in  the  electrostatic  interactions\namong  the  substrate,  silica  and  the  pads.\n\n4.5.  Oxide  and  nitride  removal  mechanisms  using  ceria  and  silica\nslurries  with  PDADMAC  (250  ppm  concentration)\n\nAdding  250  ppm  PDADMAC  to  either  ceria-  or  silica-based  slur-\nries,  the  RRs  of  both  oxide  and  nitride  ﬁlms  were  suppressed  on  both\nthe  pads.  As  discussed  earlier  [13],  this  is  a  result  of  the  adsorption\nof  PDADMAC  on  both  the  oxide  and  nitride  surfaces,  blocking  the\ncontact  between  the  abrasives  and  the  ﬁlms  being  polished,  and\nresulting  in  the  suppression  of  RRs.  The  pads  apparently  play  no\nrole  here.\n\n5.  Conclusions\n\nWe   showed  that,  while  using  aqueous  solutions  of  PDAD-\nMAC,  the  poly-Si  RRs  drop  dramatically  from  about  500  nm/min\nto  <1  nm/min  when  the  polishing  pad  was   changed  from  an\nIC1000  pad  to  a  Politex  pad.  Based  on  elemental  analysis,  EDS   and\nXPS  data,  we  hypothesized  that  the  PDADMAC-mediated  bridg-\ning  interaction  between  the  poly-Si  surface  and  the  Politex  pad\nis  weaker  than  that  between  poly-Si  and  IC1000.  Using  PDAD-\nMAC   complex  formation  with  eosin,  and  UV–vis  experiments,  we\nconﬁrmed  that  PDADMAC  interacts  only  weakly  with  the  Poli-\ntex  pad,  but  strongly  with  an  IC1000  pad.  In  the  case  of  IC1000\npad,  stronger  polycation-mediated  bridging  interactions  with  the\npoly-Si  substrate  facilitate  high  RRs  by  rupturing  the  underlying\nSi–Si  bonds.  In  contrast,  weaker  interaction  between  PDADMAC\nand  the  Politex  surface  results  in  no  poly-Si  removal  with  this\npad.\n\nOn  adding  ceria  or  silica  abrasives  to  a  PDADMAC  solution,\nthe  poly-Si  RRs  using  the  Politex  pad  were  still  very  low  com-\npared  to  those  with  the  IC1000  pad.  In  the  presence  of  PDADMAC,\nthe  RRs  of  both  oxide  and  nitride  ﬁlms  were  suppressed  on\nboth  pads,  presumably  due  to  the  stronger  substrate  Si–O  and\nSi–N  bonds  (in  contrast  to  the  less  strong  Si–Si  bonds  in  the\ncase  of  poly-Si)  when  compared  to  the  strength  of  the  bridging\nattraction.\n\n\f28\n\nN.K.
