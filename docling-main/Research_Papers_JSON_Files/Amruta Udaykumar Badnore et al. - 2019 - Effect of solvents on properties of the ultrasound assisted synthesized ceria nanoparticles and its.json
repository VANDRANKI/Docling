The different solvents\nemployed were methanol (MeOH), ethylene glycol (EG), water (aq) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The ceria\nnanoparticles were synthesized without the use of any capping agent in 20 min. The yield obtained was\naround 90% for the synthesized ceria samples. As synthesized ceria nanoparticles were characterized by\nX-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), Brunauer Emmett\nTeller (BET) and zeta (f) potential in order to determine the inﬂuence of solvent on the physical properties\nof ceria nanoparticles. All the ceria samples illustrated a predominant spherical shape with the size in the\nrange of 5–20 nm. It was found that interaction of the solvent with ceria nanoparticles in the presence of\nultrasound plays an important role in modulating crystallite size, surface charge and its adsorption per-\nformance for a xylene milling yellow 6G dye. Among all the sonicated ceria samples, IPA mediated ceria\nexhibited highest positive zeta potential and hence was found to be proﬁcient for the complete removal\nof dye in 15 min. Furthermore, the adsorption of the yellow milling dye on the surface of (IPA mediated)\nsonicated ceria sample has shown to follow pseudo-ﬁrst order kinetic model. The non-sonicated sample\n(prepared in MeOH solvent without ultrasound) shows negligible dye adsorption while sonicated sample\nreveals 50% removal of XMY dye due to the difference in zeta potential values resulted from the cavitation\neffects.\n(cid:1) 2019 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Introduction\n\nCeria or Cerium Oxide (CeO2) is a crystalline rare earth oxide\nand has attracted a lot of attention in the past few years owing\nits unique properties. The properties like ultraviolet radiation\nabsorbing ability [1], high hardness index, high catalytic activity\nfor reactions like wet air oxidation, reactivity and its stability at\nhigher temperature allow it to have many applications [2]. Ceria\nhas mainly been used in its nanoparticle form and has been devel-\noped for various applications such as glass polishing material [3],\ncatalytic support or promoter [4], gas sensor [5], oxygen ion con-\n\n⇑ Corresponding author at: Chemical Engineering Division, Institute of Chemical\nTechnology, Matunga, Mumbai 400 019, India.\n\nE-mail address: ab.pandit@ictmumbai.edu.in (A.B.

The sonochemical\n(acoustic cavitation) method of synthesis has been a very well-\nestablished method of nanoparticle synthesis for obtaining smaller\nand uniform particle size and high surface area [23]. This method is\nknown to be simple to employ and cost effective on a lab scale.\nThere are hotspots created through the adiabatic compressions or\nshockwave formation within the gas-vapour phase of the collaps-\ning bubbles due to the implosion of the gas bubbles in acoustic cav-\nitation [23,24]. The temperature inside the hotspot can reach up to\n(cid:1)5000 (cid:3)C and the pressure can be >1800 atm [25]. Thus, ultrasonic\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apt.2019.03.001\n0921-8831/(cid:1) 2019 The Society of Powder Technology Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V. and The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Badnore et al. / Advanced Powder Technology 30 (2019) 1058–1066\n\n1059\n\nwaves in acoustic cavitation producing local high temperature and\npressure spots, which aid in the formation of nanoparticles.\n\nSome recent\n\nresearch articles have illustrated the ceria\nnanoparticle synthesis in different solvents. However, they have\nnot studied the adsorption performance of the synthesized ceria\nnanostructures. Remani et al. have synthesized ceria nanoparticles\nin alcohol-water mixed solvents using ammonia and cerium\nnitrate hexahydrate as reactants via precipitation method [26].\nGu et al. have reported ceria (cerium oxide) nanoparticle synthesis\nby decomposing cerium oleate complex in different high boiling\nsolvents [27]. From these previously reported works, it can be\ninferred that the choice of the solvent is important as the solvent\nproperties such as polarity, viscosity, chain length, dielectric con-\nstant affects the synthesised nanoparticle physical characteristic.\nThe milling yellow dye is an azo dye. The ceria nanoparticles are\nproved to be used for the adsorption of the azo dyes [28]. The elec-\ntrostatic attraction between protonated hydroxyl surface of ceria\nand anionic dye ions of the dissociated sulphonate group promotes\nthe adsorption of dye molecules.\n\nIn this report, ceria nanoparticles were synthesised at room\ntemperature in different solvents viz. water, isopropyl alcohol,\nethylene glycol and methanol using sonication assisted co-\nprecipitation technique. A sample was synthesized in MeOH sol-\nvent without ultrasound but with a magnetic stirrer for the agita-\ntion. The yield of the synthesized ceria samples was evaluated. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to synthesize\nceria nanoparticles in different solvents using sonication technique\nto explore the physical properties as well its adsorption efﬁcacy.\nFurthermore, the kinetics of xylene milling yellow 6G dye adsorp-\ntion on ceria nanoparticles (synthesized in solvent with suitable\nproperties) has been studied.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nCerium nitrate hexahydrate (99% purity) was obtained from S.\nD. Fine Chemicals Ltd., Mumbai, India. Sodium hydroxide (97.5%\npurity) and the HPLC grade solvents- deionized water (DI water),\nethylene glycol (EG), methanol (MeOH) and isopropyl alcohol\n(IPA) were obtained from Thomas Baker Chemicals Pvt. Ltd., Mum-\nbai, India. Xylene milling yellow 6G dye (98% purity) was pur-\nchased from Bombay Chemicals, India.\n\nUltrasound set up\n\nA horn type ultrasound equipment was used for synthesis of\nceria nanoparticles. The speciﬁcations of the equipment are given\nbelow.\n\nMake: Dakshin India Ltd, Mumbai.\nOperating frequency: 20 KHz, Diameter of stainless steel tip of\nhorn: 0.019 m and Surface area of ultrasound irradiating face:\n2.83 (cid:3) 10-4 m2.\n\nEnergy provided during sonochemical synthesis method\n(US)\n(cid:4) Actual efﬁciency of horn when it was operated for 7.5 min on\ncycle (irradiation time) calculated by calorimetric meth-\nod = m.Cp.dT\n\n= 64.58 g (cid:3) 4.18 J/g (cid:3)C(cid:3)(43–29)oC = 3779.2 J\n\n(cid:4) Theoretical efﬁciency of horn = Rated horn power (cid:3) Irradia-\n\ntion time of horn i.e.7.5 min\n\n= 340 (cid:3) 7.5 min (cid:3) 60 s = 153,000 J\n(cid:4) Efﬁciency of horn = Actual g/Theoretical g\n\n= 3779.2 J/153,000 J = 2.47%\n\n2.2. Synthesis of ceria nanoparticles\n\nBelow is the reaction scheme for the ceria nanoparticle synthe-\n\nsis. It is an instantaneous and co-precipitation type of reaction.\n\n2CeðNO3\n\nÞ\n\n3\n\n(cid:5) 6H2O þ 6NaOH ! 2CeO2 þ 6NaNO3 þ 9H2O\n\nCerium nitrate hexahydrate, 7.65 g (17.44 mmol) was dissolved\nin 60 ml of deionised water and sodium hydroxide, 2.14 g\n(52.166 mmol) was dissolved in 40 ml of deionised water sepa-\nrately with the aid of a water bath at 70 (cid:3)C. The solutions were\nallowed to cool naturally. The sodium hydroxide solution was then\nadded dropwise to the cerium nitrate hexahydrate solution under\nsonication at 20 KHz frequency with 1 s pulse and 1 s relaxation\ncycle from time t = 0 min (from start of addition) over 22 min.\nThe time taken for the complete addition of sodium hydroxide\nsolution to cerium nitrate hexahydrate solution was 22 min. The\naddition time was decided based on mixing time experiment\ndescribed in our earlier work [29]. The mixture (sodium hydroxide\nand cerium nitrate hexahydrate solution) was further irradiated for\n18 more min under same sonication parameters as that were used\nduring the addition of sodium hydroxide solution to the cerium\nnitrate hexahydrate solution. Further irradiation time was ﬁxed\nbased on the maximum yield obtained. Similarly, Pinjari et al. have\noptimized the time required for ceria synthesis process based on\nthe yield obtained and have reported that 18 more mins were\nrequired for the maximum ceria yield. It was for their experimental\nset-up, which was similar to that described in this work [30]. Dif-\nferent solvents viz. ethylene glycol (EG), methanol (MeOH) and iso-\npropanol (IPA) were employed instead of water in order to study\nthe inﬂuence of solvent on the yield, surface and structural as well\nas adsorption properties of CeO2 NPs. All reactions were carried out\nat room temperature i.e. 27 ± 2 (cid:3)C. But there was rise in tempera-\nture of the reaction mixture. The rise in temperature was around\n10 (cid:3)C after 20 min of ultrasound irradiation due to the hot spots\ngenerated during cavitation.\n\nAfter the sonication the solution containing ceria nanoparticles\nwas centrifuged using Tarsons 250 ml tubes with Eltek Centrifuge\nRC 4100F, being set at 7000 rpm (8052.95g) rotating speed and for\n15 min of operating time. Supernatant was decanted while bottom\nyellow residue containing ceria nanoparticles was reslurried in\ndeionised water using an ultrasonic horn for 4 min to ensure that\nthe ceria nanoparticles were dispersed completely before the next\nstage of centrifugation. In the second phase of centrifugation, the\nreslurried yellow solution was\ncentrifuged at 7000 rpm\n(8052.95g) for 30 min. Again, the obtained ceria nanoparticles\nwere reslurried and washing process was repeated to remove the\ntraces of solvent used during the reaction and the by-product,\nsodium nitrate before the third centrifugation. Finally, after third\ncentrifugation, the collected ceria nanoparticles were redispersed\nin small amount of methanol for drying. When methanol gets\nevaporated the nanoparticles were oven dried at 100 (cid:3)C for 48 h.\nThereafter the dried ceria nanoparticles were weighed, crushed\nwith a mortar and pestle and stored in a desiccator for analysis.\n\nA single experiment was conducted to synthesize ceria in\nmethanol solvent without the use of horn, using same concentra-\ntion of reactants and conditions as that used in above described\nultrasound irradiation method. The horn was replaced with a mag-\nnetic stirrer for the agitation and the sample synthesized is termed\nas non-sonicated ceria sample.\n\n2.3. Adsorption experiments to study adsorption performance of the\nsynthesized ceria nanoparticles\n\nIn order to test dye adsorption performance of the synthesized\nceria nanoparticles, adsorption experiment was carried as follows:\n\n\f1060\n\nA.U. Badnore et al. / Advanced Powder Technology 30 (2019) 1058–1066\n\nIn a typical adsorption experiment, 50 mg/L concentration of dye\nsolution was prepared in a deionised water. The prepared dye solu-\ntion (50 ml) was taken into a 100 ml beaker and the beaker was\nkept on a magnetic stirrer at an agitation speed of 500 rpm. 0.1 g\nof the synthesized ceria nanoparticles were added to the beaker\ncontaining the dye solution. An aliquot (2 ml) of the dye solution\nwas pipetted out after every 5 min and was centrifuged (Lab Quest\nMCF08 VT centrifugation machine) at 6000 rpm (1854.72g) for\n10 min. The absorbance of the obtained supernatant was checked\nby the UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800) in scan range\nof 200–500 nm wavelength. Each time, 1 ml supernatant sample\nwas diluted with 1 ml of deionised water into the cuvette and\nthe absorbance was measured. Similar procedure was repeated\nfor each synthesized ceria nanoparticle to study and compare the\nadsorption rate of the dye on the nanoparticles. All the experi-\nments were performed at room temperature.\n\nTo quantify and separate the solvent interaction and cavitation\neffect, an experiment was performed for the adsorption of XMY\ndye on non-sonicated ceria sample.\n\n2.4. Experimental procedure to determine adsorption capacity and\nkinetics of XMY dye adsorption on ceria sample (synthesized in\nisopropyl solvent)\n\nTo know the adsorption capacity of the ceria nanoparticles (syn-\nthesized in IPA solvent), a dye solution of 100 mg/L concentration\nwas made. 50 ml of the prepared dye solution was taken into a\nbeaker and the beaker was kept on a magnetic stirrer with an agi-\ntation speed of 500 rpm. Synthesized ceria nanoparticles (0.02 g)\nwere added to the beaker containing known concentration\n(100 mg/L) of dye solution and the samples were taken out at reg-\nular intervals to check their absorbance values after the separation\nof the suspended ceria nanoparticles by centrifugation. Absorbance\nof the aliquots was checked with the similar method described in\nSection 2.3. Experiments were carried out at room temperature.\n\nTo predict the adsorption kinetics of the dye on CeO2 NPs (syn-\nthesized in IPA solvent), initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L and\nan amount of 0.1 g ceria was chosen.\n\n3. Characterization\n\nThe ceria nanoparticles were characterized by X-Ray diffrac-\ntometer (Bruker D8 advance, Germany) equipped with Cu Ka\n(k = 1.54 Å) radiation source. The scan range of secondary mono-\nchromator was 10–80(cid:3) (2h-scale). The step of 0.02(cid:3) per 0.2 s was\ngiven during the scan. The surface morphology and the particle size\nof ceria samples were estimated by JEOL JSM-7600F Field emission\ngun-scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) instrument. BET\n(Brunauer Emmett Teller) analysis was carried out on Smart Sorb\n92/93 BET surface area analyser to estimate the surface area of\nthe synthesized nanoparticles. The zeta (f) potential and hydrody-\nnamic particle size of the synthesized ceria samples were investi-\ngated using NanoPlusAnalyzer, Germany.\n\n4. Results and discussion\n\n4.1. Yield and reaction time\n\nPinjari et al. reported that the time required for sonochemical\nsynthesis of ceria nanoparticle was 20 min as against 4 h time\nrequired for conventional method of ceria synthesis [30]. Further-\nmore, they have evaluated and inferred that sonochemical method\nis energy efﬁcient over conventional method of ceria synthesis as it\nsaved more than 92% process energy. In this study, similar observa-\ntion for reaction time have been found as that inferred by Pinjari\n\net al. The time required for the complete conversion of reactants\nto form product (ceria) was found to be 20 min. Table 1 shows\nthe yield assessed for the sonochemically synthesized ceria\nnanoparticles in different solvents.\nIn all solvents, the yield\nobtained was in the range of 85–90% (Table 1) for 20 min reaction\ntime. The percentage yield of ceria nanoparticle was calculated by\ntaking the ratio of the measured ﬁnal weight (average) of the ceria\nproduct after drying (after separating the by-products) to the sto-\nichiometrically expected weight of product (ceria).\n\n4.2. XRD analysis\n\nFig. 1 depicts X-ray diffraction pattern of ceria nanoparticles\nsynthesized in different (IPA, EG, H2O and MeOH) solvents using\nsonication method. XRD patterns were investigated to conﬁrm pro-\nduct purity and to determine the crystallite size and phase of the\nsynthesized CeO2 NPs.\n\nAll the diffractograms (Fig. 1) displays nine peaks and are in\ngood agreement with JCPDS card No. 34-0394 for ceria. 2 Theta val-\nues of all the ceria samples (as shown in Fig. 1.) well matches with\neach other. No additional peak was observed in the diffractograms\nin the Fig. 1 which indicates that the pure phase of ceria was\nformed. As per the JCPDS data, the observed nine peaks at 2h in\nthe XRD spectra can be indexed to face-centered cubic structure\nof crystalline ceria formed. All the peaks (Fig. 1) show broadening\nand is ascribed to the formation of ceria nanocrystals in ultrasound\nassisted solvent mediated synthesis technique. Debye scherrer for-\nmula was used to determine crystallite size of the ceria samples\nconsidering highest intensity peak position of 28.29(cid:3). Crystallite\nsize values are displayed in Table 1. Debye scherrer formula is\nexpressed as D = K. k/b(cid:5)cos h and our previous work describes the\nterms in the given formula [29].\n\nThe crystallite size of ceria sample increases (Table 1) with an\nincrease in the boiling point of the solvents. The crystallite size\nof ceria was found to be lowest in MeOH (4.37 nm) as compared\nto that obtained in other three solvents viz. IPA, EG and H2O (illus-\ntrated in Table 1). This can be attributed to the lower boiling point\nof the MeOH. The lower is the boiling point of the solvent, higher is\nthe vapour pressure which causes cavitation to be less effective i.e.\nit lowers collapse intensity of bubbles as the vapour enters the\nbubbles formed. Also lower the boiling point of solvent, lower it\nis heated owing to which it interacts less with the ultrasound\nwaves [31,32]. It (less solvent interaction with ultrasound waves)\ncauses methoxy groups of the solvent (methanol) to get locations\nmajorly on the ceria surfaces preventing crystal growth of\nnanoparticles. This will envisage the crystallite size of CeO2 NPs\nto be smaller. The crystallite size of ceria was found to highest\n(7.60 nm) in EG solvent. This is owing to low vapor pressure of\nthe EG solvent due to which cavitation events are more intense\nthough fewer in number and hence more effective locally. This is\nbecause at low vapor pressure of ﬂuid, the bubbles are less occu-\npied with the solvent vapours so the collapse of the bubbles are\nmore violent. The increased diffusion and microstreaming during\ncavitation promote the migration of most of the solvent molecules\naway from ceria surfaces. This allows ceria crystals to get orienta-\ntion at speciﬁc location which facilitates growth of the crystals\nresulting into higher crystallite size.\n\nThe % crystallinity of ceria samples were computed by the\nmethod described in our earlier work [29]. From the Table 2 it\ncan be inferred that for all the ceria samples, the % crystallinity\ncomputed was found to be consistent with the crystallite size val-\nues. Hence the % crystallinity of ceria synthesized in EG solvent\nwas observed to be highest (15.77%) while that synthesized in\nMeOH solvent was found to be lowest (9.04%). These results are\nin accordance with data observed for the synthesized ZnO NPs\n\n\fA.U.

FEG-SEM analysis\n\nFig. 2 demonstrates the FEG-SEM micrographs of as synthesized\nceria nanoparticles in solvents viz. ethylene glycol, methanol,\nwater and isopropyl alcohol using sonication method. The effect\nof solvents on the structure of ceria samples were investigated\nby FEG-SEM analysis. All the FEG-SEM micrographs shown in\nFig. 2 are at a magniﬁcation of 100,000(cid:3). All the FEG-SEM micro-\ngraphs illustrates predominant spherical shape of ceria nanoparti-\ncles. The particle size was calculated from SEM images by\nconsidering the population of 50 particles of a sample and averag-\ning their size. The scale given in the FEG-SEM images was used to\nassess the size of the particles. The lower boiling point ensued\nsmaller particles while higher boiling point will lead to higher size\nof nuclei formation under cavitation conditions as mentioned ear-\nlier in Section 4.2. The atomic size decides the crystallite size while\nthe particle size is the aggregation of a number of atoms. So, the\nparticle size of the samples is greater than their crystallite size val-\nues (Tables 1 and 2). The particle size of ceria nanoparticles follows\nsame kind of order of increase as those yielded for the crystallite\nsize values, evidenced in Table 2. The average particle size mea-\nsured from FEG-SEM images for all the ceria samples are in good\nagreement with the particle size distribution observed. The particle\n\nsize distribution of ceria samples obtained by dynamic light scat-\ntering (DLS) method are illustrated in Table 2. The obtained parti-\ncle size distribution for MeOH mediated ceria sample was found to\nbe narrower as compared to the other three ceria samples. The rea-\nson being the conﬁnement of nuclei formed during the CeO2 NPs\nsynthesis in lower boiling point solvent causing generation of\nsmaller particles. In all four solvents, the particle size of CeO2\nNPs are in the range of 5–20 nm (Fig. 2). The smallest size of ceria\nwas obtained in methanol solvent and the average particle size is\nestimated to be 9.89 nm (Table 2).\n\n4.4. BET analysis\n\nThe textural properties of the as synthesized ceria samples\n(adsorbent) were analysed by BET analyser. The measured surface\narea of the synthesized ceria samples is shown in Table 2. Samples\nwere degassed prior to the analysis at 100 (cid:3)C for 2 h. There is phys-\nical adsorption of nitrogen gas on the solid surface of the samples\nat liquid nitrogen temperature of (cid:6)196.15 (cid:3)C. At 0.970 relative\npressure (P/P0) which is used to assess their surface area. The sur-\nface area was determined by single point measurement method.\n\nThe smaller size of nanoparticles provides higher surface area.\nHence, ceria sample synthesized in methanol solvent possess high-\nest surface area (Table 2) as compared to the samples synthesized\nin other solvents (EG, IPA and H2O). The measured surface area of\nceria samples is consistent with the crystallite size examined\n\n\f1062\n\nA.U. Badnore et al. / Advanced Powder Technology 30 (2019) 1058–1066\n\nFig. 2. FEG-SEM images of ceria nanoparticles synthesized in (a) ethylene glycol, (b) methanol, (c) water and (d) isopropyl alcohol using sonication method at room\ntemperature.\n\n(Table 2) except CeO2 NPs synthesized in EG solvent. This can be\nattributed to the diol functional group of ethylene glycol which\nnot only acts as a solvent but also as a surfactant during ceria syn-\nthesis. This forms the uniform spherical structure of ceria nanopar-\nticles consequently increasing its surface area. A similar outcome\nof structure uniformity was inferred from the Hai et al. study\n[33]. They observed that the ethylene glycol acts as a surfactant\nas well as the solvent for improving the size uniformity of the mag-\nnesium oxide nanoparticles. Further, solvent has also decreased\nthe agglomeration degree of the formed MgO nanoparticles.\n\n4.5. Zeta (f) potential\n\nZeta potential (surface charge) plays an imperative role in\nadsorption of dye molecule. It inﬂuences the rate of adsorption of\ndye. Zeta potential measurements of the synthesized CeO2 NPs\nare elucidated in Table 3. Around 5 mg of each ceria sample was\ndispersed in 10 ml of deionised water by sonication in ultrasonic\nbath for 15 min. After dispersion of nanoparticles of ceria in water,\nceria samples were subsequently analysed for zeta potential.\n\nTable 3\nZeta potential of ceria nanoparticles synthesized in different\nsolvents.\n\nSolvent\n\nEthylene glycol\nMethanol\nWater\nIsopropyl alcohol\n\nZeta potential (mV)\n\n19.19\n(cid:6)3.09\n15.19\n37.74\n\nThe ceria nanoparticles synthesized in IPA solvent possess high-\nest positive zeta potential (37.74 mV) as compared to the ceria\nsamples synthesized in other solvents (Table 3). The zeta potential\nof the nanoparticles synthesized in isopropanol, water and ethy-\nlene glycol follow the polarity trend. IPA being the least polar\nhas the highest zeta potential and water being the most polar\nhas the lowest zeta potential. Methanol is an outlier due to the\nhigh adsorption of methoxy groups on the active sites. This could\nbe due to the high acidity of methanol, due to which methanol\ncan easily dissociate into methoxy group and get adsorbed on\nthe nanoparticles [34]. The reason for the difference in zeta poten-\ntial can be explained based on the polarity of the solvents used. IPA\nbeing the least polar as compared to other solvents (H2O and EG),\ncannot dissociate easily to form H+ and its conjugate base. As\nagainst this, water being more polar as compared to the solvents\nIPA and EG, will dissociate easily to interact with ceria surfaces\nthus reducing its zeta potential value.\n\nSo, the interaction of solvent species with ceria nanoparticles\nplays an important role in inﬂuencing the nature of zeta potential\nof synthesized ceria nanoparticles. Based on this, IPA mediated\nceria sample could be best speculated to adsorb anionic dye species.\n\n4.6. Adsorption efﬁciency of the synthesized ceria nanoparticles\n\nThe experimental method is described in Section 2.3 to check\nthe adsorption performance of dye on the four different synthe-\nsized ceria nanoparticles. Fig. 3 elucidates maximum absorption\nof xylene milling yellow 6G (XMY) dye at 398.5 nm wavelength\nso the residual dye concentration is measured at 398.5 nm wave-\nlength for further UV analysis.\n\n\fA.U. Badnore et al. / Advanced Powder Technology 30 (2019) 1058–1066\n\n1063\n\nFig. 3. Adsorption of xylene milling yellow dye by ceria nanoparticles (synthesized in IPA solvent). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the\nreader is referred to the web version of this article.)\n\nplete removal of dye by CeO2 NPs (synthesized in IPA solvent) was\nonly 15 min. This can be attributed to the highest zeta potential\n(f = +37.74 mV) of CeO2 NPs synthesized in IPA solvent as com-\npared to the ceria nanoparticles synthesized into other solvent sys-\ntem (MeOH, DI H2O and EG) as is evident from Table 3. This implies\nthat the surface of CeO2 NPs synthesized in IPA solvent are more\npositively charged as compared to the CeO2 NPs synthesized into\nMeOH, DI H2O and EG as a solvent. This leads to an electrostatic\nattraction of anionic species of XMY dye on the surface of CeO2\nNPs (synthesized in IPA solvent).\n\nFor the EG and H2O mediated synthesized ceria samples, the\ntime taken for the complete removal of XMY anionic species was\nfound to be 25 and 45 min respectively. The longest time (more\nthan 60 mins) taken for complete removal of XMY dye species\nwas observed for CeO2 NPs synthesized in methanol solvent. This\nis attributed to the negative surface charge of the CeO2 NPs which\nincreases the magnitude of the repulsive force between XMY anio-\nnic species and negatively charged CeO2 NPs. It could be inferred\nfrom the Fig. 4A, that the rate of dye adsorption is a function of zeta\npotential of the synthesized ceria nanoparticles.\n\nThe order of adsorption efﬁciency of the synthesized ceria\n\nnanoparticles in different solvents is shown below.\n\nIPA > EG > H2O > MeOH\n\nThis trend doesn’t concur with the surface area trend observed\nin Table 2. This is because the dye is anionic, the surface charge\nplays a major role in determining the nanoparticle’s adsorption\n\nFig. 4A. Comparative analysis of the adsorption rates displayed by the ceria\nnanoparticles synthesized in Methanol, DI Water, Ethylene glycol and Isopropyl\nalcohol.\n\nFig. 4A represent the adsorption performance of XMY dye on the\nsurfaces of ceria nanoparticles fabricated in MeOH, DI H2O, EG and\nIPA solvents.

If it had not been any difference in the surface charge of\nceria samples then the surface area would have contributed more\nto its physical adsorption efﬁciency than their zeta potential\nvalues.\n\nThus, it can be concluded that adsorption efﬁciency of ceria\nnanoparticles follows a similar trend as that observed for the zeta\npotential results (Table 3).\n\nThe non-sonicated and sonicated ceria sample, synthesized in\nmethanol solvent were used to analyse and compare the adsorp-\ntion rate of XMY dye on the synthesized ceria samples as depicted\nin Fig. 4B. Also, Fig. 4B demonstrates the adsorption rate of dye on\nthe ceria synthesized in IPA solvent under sonication. It (ceria sam-\nple) has the highest zeta potential i.e. 37.74 mV and hence the\nhighest anion adsorption efﬁciency.\n\nFig. 4B shows that the adsorption rate of dye on sonicated sam-\nple is much faster as compared to the dye adsorption rate on non-\nsonicated sample for methanol solvent. At 120 min, the non-\nsonicated sample shows negligible dye adsorption while sonicated\nsample reveals 50% removal of XMY dye (Fig. 4B). This is attributed\nto characteristics of cavitation in solvent medium. The cavitation\ninduced during ceria synthesis in methanol solvent, preclude the\ninteraction of methoxy group with ceria nanoparticle surface. As\n\nagainst this under the cavitation free condition, the solvent-\nnanoparticle interactions are promoted resulting into the zeta\npotential of (cid:6)29.49 mV (f of sonicated sample = (cid:6)3.09 mV) for\nthe non-sonicated sample. This has extremely reduced the dye\nadsorption efﬁciency of non-sonicated sample. The shock waves\ngenerated during cavitation reduces the interaction of methoxy\nspecies with ceria surfaces. Thus, it can be inferred that cavitation\nplays a major role in altering the surface properties of the synthe-\nsized ceria nanoparticles.\n\n4.7. Adsorption capacity\n\nThe adsorption capacity of ceria nanoparticles (synthesized in\nisopropyl solvent) was calculated as it gave the highest rate (Refer\nto the Fig. 4) of dye adsorption. The formula for calculating adsorp-\ntion capacity is given below.\nAdsorption capacity : qe\n\n¼ ðCo (cid:6) CeÞ (cid:3) V=W\n\nwhere qe is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium time (mg/g),\nCo is the initial concentration of dye (mg/L), Ce is the equilibrium\nconcentration of dye after adsorption (mg/L), V is the volume of\nthe dye solution (L) and W is the amount of ceria nanoparticle (g).\n\nFig. 5. Kinetics plot for XMY dye adsorption on CeO2 NPs (synthesized in IPA solvent).\n\nFig. 6. Concentration of dye adsorbed on ceria (IPA mediated ceria sample) for initial dye concentration of 50 ppm and at 0.1 g of catalyst loading.\n\n\fA.U. Badnore et al. / Advanced Powder Technology 30 (2019) 1058–1066\n\n1065\n\nSo, the adsorption capacity of ceria nanoparticle (synthesized in\nIPA solvent) was evaluated to be 93.354 mg/g for the speciﬁed\nexperimental conditions mentioned in Section 2.4.\n\n4.8. Kinetic study\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nWe are grateful to the UGC (University Grants Commission),\nIndia, for ﬁnancial assistance and would also like thank UGC for\nproviding a fellowship to one of the authors, AUB.\n\nSince the active sites of ceria nanoparticles were in excess\n(please refer supplementary information), the residual dye concen-\ntrations were measured initially and at particular time intervals.\nFrom this data the qe and the qt values were calculated.\n\nAppendix A. Supplementary material\n\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apt.2019.03.001.\n\nwhere qt = (Dye adsorbed (cid:3) Vol. of beaker)/Amount of ceria\nused\n\nReferences\n\n= (Dye adsorbed (cid:3) 50/1000)/0.02 g\n\nand qe = qt at equilibrium\n\nThe linearized form of the pseudo-ﬁrst order equation [35] is:\n\nlnðqe\n\n(cid:6) qt\n\nÞ ¼ lnqe\n\n(cid:6) k1 (cid:3) t\n\nThe data obtained was analysed by allowing it to ﬁt into the\nLagergren’s pseudo-ﬁrst order kinetic model. From Fig. 5 it can\nbe inferred that adsorption data satisﬁes well pseudo-ﬁrst order\nkinetic model expression with rate dependency on dye concentra-\ntion. The experimental data obeys pseudo-ﬁrst order kinetics. The\nresultant plot has good correlation coefﬁcient (R2) value of 0.98.\nHence the adsorption of yellow milling dye on the surface of (IPA\nmediated) synthesized ceria nanoparticles has been proposed to\nfollow pseudo-ﬁrst order kinetic model.\n\nFig. 6 illustrates the graph of the concentration of dye adsorbed\n(mg/L) on IPA mediated ceria sample versus time (min). From the\nnature of the graph, we can predict that the dye diffusion through\nthe surface boundary of the ceria particles and attains equilibrium.\nFurther, the nature of the plot obtained shows that the dye does\nnot diffuse into the pores of the ceria sample hence pseudo second\norder and intraparticle diffusion does not have a signiﬁcant role in\nthe adsorption process.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nCeria nanoparticles were successfully synthesized in different\nsolvents like methanol, water, isopropyl alcohol and ethylene gly-\ncol at room temperature using sonication method in 20 min. The\ntechnique was fast, simple and energy efﬁcient to account around\n90% yield of all the synthesized ceria samples. It was found that\ninteraction of the solvent with ceria nanoparticles in the presence\nof ultrasound modulated the physical properties and adsorption\nefﬁciency of ceria for a xylene milling yellow 6G dye. The\nultrasound-assisted ceria sample synthesized in isopropyl solvent\nshowed highest positive zeta potential (+37.74 mV) and adsorption\nefﬁcacy (complete removal of dye in 15 min) as compared to other\nthree solvents (EG, H2O and MeOH) used in this work. Hence sol-\nvent choice was inferred to be an important criterion in governing\nthe rate of adsorption of dyes on ceria nanoparticles. The maxi-\nmum adsorption capacity of IPA mediated ceria (sonicated) sample\nwas found to be 93.35 mg of dye/g of ceria. Moreover, the adsorp-\ntion of the yellow milling dye on the surface of synthesized ceria\nnanoparticles (IPA mediated) results reveal to have followed a\npseudo-ﬁrst order kinetic model. Under the cavitation free condi-\ntion, the solvent-nanoparticle interactions are promoted resulting\ninto the zeta potential of (cid:6)29.49 mV (f of sonicated, methanol\nmediated sample = (cid:6)3.09 mV) for the non-sonicated, methanol\nmediated ceria sample. The non-sonicated sample shows negligi-\nble dye adsorption while sonicated sample reveals 50% removal\nof XMY dye.\n\n[1] S. Tsunekawa, R. Sahara, Y. Kawazoe, A.
