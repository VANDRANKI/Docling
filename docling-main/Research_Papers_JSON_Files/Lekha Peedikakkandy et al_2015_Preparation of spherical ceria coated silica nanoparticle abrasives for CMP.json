Introduction\n\nChemical  Mechanical  Polishing  (CMP)  processes  are  being  uti-\nlized  to  achieve  global  planarization  of  substrates  with  surface\ncoatings  of  varying  thickness  ranging  from  nanometres  to  several\nmicrometres,  with  desired  selectivity  and  minimum  defects  [1–3].\nInitially,  CMP   was  majorly  used  for  planarization  of  silicon  sub-\nstrates  but  has  also  subsequently  found  application  in  polishing\nsemiconductors,  metals  and  polymer  surfaces  for  technologies  like\nintegrated  circuit  (IC)  manufacturing  and  micro-electromechanical\nsystems  (MEMS)  [2].  In  CMP,  both  chemical  and  mechanical  prop-\nerties  of  the  abrasive  particles  play  a  crucial  role  in  achieving  high\npolishing  rates.  The  chemical  nature,  size  and  shape  of  the  abrasive\nparticles  used  in  polishing  slurry  play  a  crucial  role  in  achieving  the\ndesired  CMP   results.  Silica  particles  have  been  used  extensively  as\nan  abrasive  in  polishing  industry.  Recently  ceria  has  also  been  used\nas  an  abrasive  because  of  its  high  chemical  selectivity,  in  compari-\nson  to  silica  [4–6].\n\n∗\n\nCorresponding  author.\nE-mail  address:  pbhargava@iitb.ac.in  (P.

In  STI  the  CMP   process  is  used  to  polish  off  the  SiO2 dielec-\ntric  layer,  down  to  the  underlying  nitride,  and  stops  at  the  nitride\nlayer.  STI  heavily  depends  on  CMP   for  selective  removal  of  SiO2\nover  SiN  layer.  Towards  this  end,  CMP   slurry  must  have  high  selec-\ntivity  to  oxide  with  respect  to  the  nitride,  and  should  leave  the\nsurface,  planar  and  defect-free  [5].  Cook  et  al.  estimated  that  one\nSiO2 molecule  is  removed  for  every  twenty-four  collisions  between\nceria  abrasive  and  silica  substrate  compare  to  500  million  collisions\nrequired  in  the  case  of  silica  abrasive.  Ceria  slurries,  selective  pol-\nishing  of  silicon  oxide  over  silicon  nitride  ﬁlms  and  higher  removal\nrates  is  explained  based  on  ceria’s  inherently  superior  chemical\nselectivity  and  higher  polishing  rates,  compared  to  silica  abrasive\nparticles  [5,6,17–19].\n\nIn  CMP,  mono-dispersity  and  morphology  of  abrasive  particles\nare  identiﬁed  as  important  factors  which  affect  the  polishing  rates\n[5–11,14].  Some  of  the  signiﬁcant  and  cost  effective  methods  for\nsynthesis  of  abrasive  particles  including  ceria  are  solvo-thermal\nmethod,  sol–gel  method,  self-assembly,  electrochemical  method\nand  micro-emulsion  method  [4].

Ceria\ncoated  silica  nanoparticle  structures  are  identiﬁed  as  a  successful\napproach  for  controlling  the  size  and  morphology  of  ceria  abrasive\nparticles  [8,20–24].  In  this  study  we  investigate  synthesis  of  less\nthan  100  nm  pseudo  ceria  particles  by  undertaking  coating  of  ﬁne\nceria  particles  over  coarser  silica.\n\nSynthesis  of  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticle  enables  modulating\nselectivity  of  the  CMP   process  to  tap  into  potential  Shallow  Trench\nIsolation  (STI)  market  [25,26].  The  presently  available/reported  lit-\nerature  and  information,  on  properties  of  ceria  in  CMP  is  minimal.\nThis  paper  demonstrates  the  synthesis  and  study  of  various  param-\neters  inﬂuencing  the  formation  of  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles\nof  size  less  than  100  nm.   CMP   abrasive  slurries  prepared  using  syn-\nthesized  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  were  used  for  studying\nSiO2:SiN  polishing  selectivity.\n\n2.  Experimental\n\n2.1.  Preparation  of  bare-silica  nanoparticles\n\nA  popular  and  widely  reported  method  for  silica  nanoparti-\ncle  synthesis  is  Stober  method  [27].  In  Stober  process,  silicon\nalkoxides  are  hydrolysed  to  silanols,  which  further  undergoes  con-\ndensation  reaction  to  form  silica  nanoparticles.  There  are  various\nmodiﬁcations  of  this  method  reported  in  the  literature  [27,28].\nBoth  sol–gel  and  microemulsion  routes  were  used  to  synthesize\nmono-dispersed  and  spherical  silica  nanoparticles  of  size  less  than\n100  nm.   It  was  observed  that  for  particles  less  than  100  nm,   using\nsol–gel  method,  it  was  difﬁcult  to  control  size  and  shape  of  the  silica\nnano  particles.  The  resulting  nanoparticles  were  highly  agglomer-\nated  with  necking  between  the  individual  nanoparticles  as  shown\nin  Fig.  1(a)  and  (c).  On  the  other  hand,  using  microemulsion  method\n\nthe  particle  size  and  shape  were  controllable.  The  well  separated\nnanoparticles  are  shown  in  Fig.  1(b)  and  (d).  In  microemulsion\nmethod,  the  surfactant  molecules  dissolved  in  organic  solvents\nforming  spherical  micelles.  Silica  nanoparticles  are  grown,  inside\nthese  micellar  micro-cavities,  by  controlled  addition  of  silicon\nalkoxides  and  catalyst  [29,30].  Fig.  1  shows  a  comparison  of  par-\nticles  synthesized  using  sol–gel  and  micro-emulsion  methods.\n\nIn  micro-emulsion  method  tetraethyl  orthosilicate  (TEOS)  was\nused  as  a  source  of  silica,  Triton  X-100  was  used  as  surfactant,\ncyclohexane  was   the  organic  phase  and  hexanol  was  used  as  co-\nsurfactant  [29].  Addition  of  a  co-surfactant  further  stabilizes  the\nmicroemulsion  system  as  it  bridges  the  oil  and  water  interface.\n25%  NH4OH  was  used  as  a  catalyst  for  the  reaction.  For  the  syn-\nthesis,  DI  water  and  ammonia  was  added  to  a  mixture  of  Triton\nX-100  and  cyclohexane  in  hexanol  under  sonication  followed  by\ndrop  wise  addition  of  TEOS.  The  reactants  were  mixed  for  24  h  dur-\ning  which  TEOS  was   hydrolysed  by  NH4OH  to  obtain  silica  particles.\nThe  use  of  surfactant  helps  in  stabilizing  the  emulsion  and  controls\nthe  morphology  of  the  silica  particles  formed.  Upon  completion\nof  reaction,  ethanol  was  added  to  the  reaction  mixture  to  break\nthe  micro-emulsion  and  release  silica  nanoparticles.  Further  these\nSiO2 nanoparticles  were  separated  using  centrifugation  method.\nCollected  particles  were  washed  twice  with  ethanol  and  DI  water.\nThese  particles  were  heated  at  250 ◦C  for  4  h  to  remove  the  surfac-\ntant  molecules  from  the  surface  before  they  were  further  used  for\nceria  coating.\n\n2.2.  Preparation  of  ceria  coated  silica  particles\n\nMono-dispersed  silica  nanoparticles  synthesized  using  micro-\nemulsion  methods  were  used  as  a  core  particle  for  further  coating\nwith  CeO2 particles.  Ce(NO3)3 was   used  as  the  source  material\nto  precipitate  ceria  over  silica  nanoparticles  [4].  As  a  ﬁrst  step\n\n\f1308 \n\nL.

Cerium  nitrate  solution  was\nadded  to  the  above  dispersion  under  continuous  stirring  followed\nby  drop  wise  addition  of  NH4OH  solution.  Stirring  was  continued\nbeyond  completion  of  NH4OH  addition  for  the  next  12  h  for  the\nreaction  to  keep  progressing.  In  order  to  achieve  complete  coating\nof  ceria  over  silica  core  particles  the  pH  (4–10)  and  temperature\n(50 ◦C–95 ◦C)  of  the  ceria  precipitation  reaction  was   varied.  Ceria\ncoated  silica  nanoparticles  were  separated  by  centrifugation\nfollowed  by  washing  repeatedly  with  de-ionized  water  to  remove\nany  possible  ionic  remnants.\n\n2.3.  Polishing  experiments\n\nPolishing  tests  were  carried  out  on  Ecomet  4+  Automet  pol-\nishing  machine  manufactured  by  Buehler  using  groove  pads  made\nof  polyurethane.  The  rotation  speed  of  the  pad  was  set  at  80  rpm\nwith  an  applied  downward  load  of  15  lbs  and  a  constant  slurry\nﬂow  rate  of  100  ml/min  was  maintained.  The  polishing  slurries\nwere  prepared  by  dispersing  silica  nanoparticles,  ceria  nanopar-\nticles  and  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  separately  in  aqueous\nmedium  with  additives  and  was  mixed  on  a  roller  miller.  Film\nthickness  reduction  of  polished  Si  wafers  was  determined  using  an\noptical  ellipsometer  (JOBIN-YVON  SPEX).  Structural  analysis  of  the\nceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  was  carried  out  using  TEM  (Philips\nCM  200  keV)  and  it  was  compared  to  particles  used  in  prepara-\ntion  of  commercial  slurries.  X-ray  diffractometer  (XRD;  Bruker\nD8-advance,  Karlsruhe,  Germany)  was  used  to  carry  out  the  phase\nanalysis  of  the  nanoparticles.  Synthesized  particles  were  charac-\nterized  by  FTIR  to  study  the  coating  and  surface  functional  groups.\nSurface  charge  of  these  particles  was  analyzed  using  zeta  potential\nmeasurements.\n\n3.

Fig.  2(b)  shows  spherical  and  mono-dispersed  silica  par-\nticles  synthesized  through  micro-emulsion  method.  The  size  and\nshape  of  silica  nanoparticles  was   controlled  by  the  size  and\nshape  of  micro-droplets  of  emulsion  by  varying  the  NH4OH  con-\ncentration  and  use  of  co-surfactant  hexanol.  Fig.  2(c)  and  (d)\nshows  TEM  images  of  ceria  particles  extracted  from  a  commercial\nslurry  and  ceria  particles  synthesized  using  precipitation  method\nrespectively.\n\nDuring  precipitation  reaction  of  ceria  on  silica  particles,  pH  and\ntemperatures  was  varied,  to  obtain  different  extents  of  ceria  coat-\ning  on  silica.  The  precipitation  of  ceria  from  cerium  nitrate  depends\non  the  reaction  pH.  Beyond  pH  6,  the  nitrates  undergo  an  exchange\nreaction  with  hydroxyl  ion  as  shown  in  Eq.  (1).  pH  of  the  precipi-\ntation  reaction  was   controlled,  by  varying  the  amount  of  NH4OH,\nand  it  was  observed  that  at  a  lower,  acidic  pH  (3–5),  ceria  forms  a\npartial  coating  on  silica  at  room  temperature  as  shown  in  Fig.  3(a).\nFor  acidic  pH,  increasing  the  reaction  temperature  from  room  tem-\nperature  to  95 ◦C  also  resulted  in  partial  coating  of  ceria  on  silica\nparticles  as  in  Fig.  3(b).\n\nCe \n\n−\n\n  O \n\n−\n\n  NO2 +\n\n  OH− →\n\n  Ce \n\n−\n\n  OH \n\n+\n\n  NO3\n\n−\n\n(1)\n\nFull  coating  of  silica  particles  by  ceria  nanoparticles  as  shown\nin  Fig.  3(c)  and  (d)  was   achieved  by  increasing  the  pH  of  precipita-\ntion  reaction  to  a  basic  pH  >  10  and  reaction  temperature  of  95 ◦C.\nThis  can  be  explained  based  on  the  electrostatic  attraction  between\nionic  precursor  of  ceria  and  surface  charge  on  silica  particles.  At\na  basic  pH,  the  surface  of  silica  particles  acquire  negative  charge\n\n\fL.  Peedikakkandy  et  al.  /  Applied  Surface  Science  357  (2015)  1306–1312 \n\n1309\n\nFig.  3.

Before  each  experiment,  the  polishing  pad  was\nconditioned  for  1  min   with  a  diamond  grit  conditioner  using  de-\nionized  water.  The  aqueous  polishing  slurry  (1  wt%)  was   sonicated\nfor  30  min   and  was  placed  on  a  roller  miller  to  maintain  good\ndispersion.  The  pH  of  slurry  before  polishing  was   measured  and\nmaintained  at  pH-5  at  which  the  silicon  oxide  wafer  and  the  ceria\nparticles  will  be  oppositely  charged  and  thus  improving  interac-\ntion  between  wafers  and  particles.  For  pH  >  5  the  particle  settling\nrate  was  found  to  be  higher  and  ceria  coated  silica  slurry  was  found\nto  be  unstable  at  basic  pH.  This  observation  is  similar  to  that  of\nbare  ceria  particle  slurry  showing  increased  particle  agglomeration\nand  reduced  removal  rates  and  stability  for  ceria  slurry  at  basic  pH\n(pH  >  7)  [1,11].\n\nThe  polishing  rates  for  SiO2 and  SiN  wafers  were  determined\nfrom  the  differences  of  the  ﬁlm  thicknesses  measured  by  ellipsome-\ntry  technique  [13].  Selective  polishing  ratio  of  12  was  observed  for\nSiO2:SiN  wafers  using  ceria  coated  silica  particles  prepared  under\ndifferent  conditions.  The  polishing  mechanism  is  explained  as  fol-\nlows.  When  ceria  abrasive  particles  come  in  contact  with  the  silica\nsurface,  a  chemical  bond  forms  between  the  ceria  particle  and  sil-\nica  surface  as  shown  in  Eq.  (2).

Conclusions\n\nThis  study  demonstrates  synthesis  of  highly  spherical  and\nmono-dispersed,  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  for  application\nas  abrasive  particles  in  selective  CMP.  Coating  of  ceria  over  sil-\nica  was  done  using  precipitation  method.  Precipitation  reactions\nwere  carried  out  by  varying  the  pH  and  reaction  temperature.  A\nuniform  and  adherent  coating  of  ceria  over  silica  was  obtained  for\nreaction  carried  out  at  95 ◦C  at  pH  10.  Coating  of  ceria  over  sil-\nica  and  dispersion  properties  were  studied  using  TEM,  EDX,  XRD\nand  zeta-potential  analyses,  and  the  results  show  formation  of\nstable  and  dispersed  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  of  size  less\nthan  100  nm.   These  uniform  and  spherical  nanoparticles  structures\nare  excellent  substitutes  for  coarser  ceria  abrasive  particles.  When\nused  as  an  abrasive  material  in  polishing  slurry,  these  less  than\n100  nm  nanoparticles  particles  considerably  reduce  the  solid  load-\ning  in  the  formulated  CMP   slurry.  Polishing  results  achieved  so  far\nshows  improvement  in  selectivity  between  SiO2 and  SiN  wafers\nusing  1  wt%  nanoparticles  particle  slurry  with  maximum  selective\nremoval  rate  of  12.\n\nThis  work  was   supported  by  Applied  Materials  Inc.  through  the\nAnnual  Sponsored  Projects  Program.
