Paik\n\nHanyang University, Seoul, South Korea\n\n11.1 Introduction\n\nSince chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) was developed in the 1980s at IBM, it\nhas played a key role for integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing (Beyer, 1999). In the IC\nfabrication process, front-end-of-line (FEOL) and back-end-of-line (BEOL) processes\nhave been crucial applications of CMP (Krishnan et al., 2009). FEOL CMP is the pro-\ncess that forms the shallow trench isolation (STI) by polishing the gap-ﬁlling materials\nsuch as SiO2. BEOL CMP is used to form metal interconnects including Al, W, and\nCu. In general, CMP slurries are composed of abrasive, oxidizer, organic compounds\nsuch as dispersant and passivation agent, and deionized water (DIW). Speciﬁc slurry\nformulations are different depending on the materials to be polished. The physico-\nchemical properties of slurry that have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on CMP performances\nare determined by the complex interactions between its components. As the design\nrule is reduced, the demands on CMP performance have become more stringent.\nThus, understanding the physicochemical properties of slurry is essential to develop\nCMP slurries for next-generation devices including new materials and complex\nstructures.\n\n11.2 Preparation of slurry for CMP\n\nThe CMP process can be divided into interlayer dielectric (ILD) CMP, STI CMP, and\nmetal (W, Cu, and Al) CMP. ILD CMP is a process that polishes dielectric materials\nsuch as SiO2 deposited between metal interconnects. Slurries are composed of abra-\nsive, dispersant, and other additives. STI CMP is a process that uniformly polishes\nthe step height of SiO2, formed by the gap-ﬁlling process, and stop on stopping layer\nsuch as the Si3N4 or poly-silicon (poly-Si) ﬁlm. There are requirements on the high\npolish rate selectivity between SiO2 and stopping materials to prevent their erosion.\nFor this reason, slurries for STI CMP contain passivation agents for high selectivity.\nContrary to ILD and STI CMP, metal ﬁlms are hard to remove using abrasives\nbecause of their inertness. Thus, metal CMP slurries need suitable oxidizers to form\nan oxidation layer on the surface that can be easily removed by abrasives.\n\nAdvances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-100165-3.00011-5\nCopyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n\n\f274\n\nAdvances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\n\nTo formulate these slurries that are suitable for each CMP process, it is very impor-\ntant to understand the role and characteristics of each component in slurries. In this sec-\ntion, we will discuss the role and characteristics of each component for CMP\nperformances in detail.\n\n11.2.1 Abrasive particles\n\nAbrasive particles are one of the main components in CMP slurry. Silica, ceria,\nalumina, and other materials have been used as abrasives. Silica abrasives have been\nwidely used for ILD, STI CMP, and metal CMP. There are two types of silica abra-\nsives: fumed and colloidal silica. Figure 11.1 shows their transmission electron micro-\nscopy (TEM) images (Zhang et al., 2012). Fumed silica, made from ﬂame pyrolysis of\nsilicon tetrachloride (SiCl4 þ 2H2O / SiO2 þ 4HCl), has been used as an abrasive\nbecause of its inexpensive price, high purity, and simple synthesis. However, it forms\na network structure in an aqueous media caused by weak hydrogen bonding, resulting\nin agglomeration. Thus, subsequent processes such as microﬂuidizer treatment and\nﬁltration process are essential to formulate CMP slurries using fumed silica. Contrary\nto fumed silica, colloidal silica can be made with the desired particle size and uniform\nsize distribution through hydrolysis of metal organic precursors (by the net reaction\nhSieOH þ HOeSih 4 hSieOeSih). Silicic acid sodium and organic silicate\nare used as precursors to prepare colloidal silica. Colloidal silica, made from silicic\nacid sodium, inevitably contains large amounts of sodium ions, which can cause severe\nproblems such as damage on the gate oxides of a device. In order to use it, the ion-\nexchange process is required to remove sodium ions. Organic silicate can produce\nhigh purity silica compared with silicic acid sodium, and be used as an abrasive for\npolishing after the washing and decant process to remove residual precursors. The\ndemands on defect become more stringent with a decrease in device dimensions.\nThus, fumed silica has recently been replaced by colloidal silica in CMP processes\nthat require high surface quality of polished ﬁlm.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n50 nm\n\n50 nm\n\nFigure 11.1 TEM images of (a) colloidal silica and (b) fumed silica nanoparticle aggregates.\nZhang et al. (2012).\n\n\fPreparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)\n\n275\n\nCeria has been used as an abrasive for ILD and STI CMP because of its high SiO2\nremoval rate (RR). It can form strong CeeOeSi bonding during SiO2 polishing, lead-\ning to a high SiO2 RR (Cook, 1990).\n\neCeeOH þ eSieO\n\n(cid:2)4eCeeOeSie þ OH\n\n(cid:2)\n\n(11.1)\n\nCeria abrasives show higher surface quality and selectivity as well as higher RRs of\nSiO2 than silica abrasives. Thus, as an abrasive for SiO2 CMP, silica is being replaced\nby ceria. Figure 11.2 shows TEM images of ceria synthesized through the solid-state\nand solution-grown method (Seo et al., 2014). The solid-state method produces ceria\nabrasives with a controllable crystallite size depending on synthesis conditions (Kim\net al., 2003). However, it has not only large particle size and poor size distribution,\nbut also an angulated shape (Figure 11.2(a)). Thus, mechanical milling and ﬁltration\nprocesses are essential to obtain the desired particle size and uniform size distribution\n(Kim et al., 2006). Compared with the solid-state method, the solution-grown method\nproduces spherical ceria abrasives with the desired particle size and uniform size dis-\ntribution (Figure 11.2(b)). These characteristics of the solution-grown ceria lead to low\ndefects during CMP. Recently, many researchers have studied the physicochemical\nproperties of solution-grown ceria to develop defect-free CMP slurries. In Section\n11.3.3, we will discuss the physicochemical properties of solution-grown ceria in\ndetail.\n\nAs an abrasive for metal CMP, alumina has been used because of high polish rate\nselectivity between metal (W or Cu) and a barrier metal (Ti/TiN or Ta/TaN) (Krishnan\net al., 2009). Alumina abrasive can exist in various phases (a, b, g, or d) depending on\nthe calcination temperature. However, it commonly generates many defects during\npolishing because of its hardness. There have been several studies to overcome these\nlimitations (Lei and Zhang, 2007; Zhang and Lei, 2008). Lei and Zhang developed the\nalumina/silica coreeshell abrasive for polishing hard disk substrates. Zhang and Lei\nreported alumina composite abrasive grafted with polymethacrylic acid for glass pol-\nishing. These composite abrasives show improved surface planarization and fewer\nscratches than pure alumina abrasives because of the cushioning effect of their\n\n(a)(a)(a)\n\n(b)(b)(b)\n\nFigure 11.2 TEM images of (a) solid-state ceria and (b) solution-grown ceria.\nSeo et al. (2014).\n\n\f276\n\nAdvances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\n\nstructure. For this reason, alumina abrasives have been used as the composite structure\nrather than in pure form.\n\n11.2.2 Dispersants\n\nDispersants are widely used to improve dispersion stability. According to the DLVO\n(Derjaguin, Landau, Vervey, and Overbeek) theory, particles in aqueous media can be\nagglomerated when van der Waals attraction is greater than electrostatic repulsion\n(Verwey et al., 1999; Derjaguin and Landau, 1941). By adding suitable dispersants,\nsteric hindrance and electrostatic stabilization between the abrasives are obtained,\nwhich prevent abrasives from agglomerating.\n\nGenerally, abrasive particles in slurry are known to undergo transitions from\nbridging agglomeration / stable / depletion ﬂocculation with an increase in disper-\nsant concentration (Kim et al., 2012). At a low concentration, dispersants are insufﬁ-\ncient for full coverage of the abrasive surface. The free segments (loops and tails) of\nthe adsorbed dispersant on the abrasive surface can attach to other abrasives, leading to\nbridging agglomeration. When an adequate amount of dispersant is added, it fully\ncovers the abrasive surface, which can improve the dispersion stability through steric\nhindrance and electrostatic stabilization. Also, dispersants should have strong adsorp-\ntion energy with the abrasive surface. Weak adsorption energy between dispersant and\nabrasive surface causes desorption of the dispersant during a particle collision, result-\ning in bridging ﬂocculation (Sigmund et al., 2000). At a high concentration of disper-\nsants, free dispersants (not adsorbed) can promote ﬂocculation of the stable slurry\nthrough a depletion mechanism (Asakura and Oosawa, 1954, 1958). When two parti-\ncle surfaces approach each other at a distance less than the effective diameter of unab-\nsorbed dispersants, the dispersants are excluded from the interparticle gap, resulting in\nan osmotic pressure. This osmotic pressure generates an attractive force between the\nabrasive particles, which promotes their ﬂocculation. Thus, it is important to add an\nadequate amount of dispersants for improved dispersion stability.\n\nLangmuir and Freundlich adsorption models can be used to describe the adsorption\nbehavior of dispersants on an abrasive surface. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm\nmodel assumes that the particle surface is homogeneously covered by the monolayer\ndispersant. It is expressed as follows:\n\nCe=Qe ¼ Ce=Qm þ 1=ðKLQmÞ\n\n(11.2)\n\nwhere Qe is the adsorbed amount of dispersant per surface area of particle at equilib-\nrium (mg/m2), Ce is the concentration of dispersant in the bulk solution (mg/L), Qm is\nthe maximum adsorbed amount of dispersant on particle surface (mg/m2), and KL is\nrelated to the afﬁnity of adsorption (L/mg). The Freundlich adsorption isotherm model\nbelow is used in heterogeneous systems:\n\nQe ¼ KFC1=n\n\ne\n\n(11.3)\n\n\fPreparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)\n\n277\n\nThe Freundlich constant KF and 1/n are constants dependent on the relative adsorp-\ntion capacity and intensity of adsorption, respectively. The values of KF and 1/n are\ndetermined from the intercept and slope of a linear plot of log Qe versus log Ce.\n\nlogQe ¼ logKF þ 1=n logCe\n\n(11.4)\n\nA smaller value of 1/n indicates a stronger bond between dispersant and particle\nsurface. To identify the adsorption behavior of dispersant, data are ﬁtted with Lang-\nmuir and Freundlich adsorption models, and the adsorption model with a higher cor-\nrelation coefﬁcient values is chosen.\n\nFigure 11.3 shows the adsorption isotherm of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) on a ceria\nsurface. The Langmuir adsorption model (R2 ¼ 0.99) is a much better ﬁt than the\nFreundlich adsorption model (R2 ¼ 0.87), which indicates that PAA covers the ceria\nsurface homogeneously.\n\nTo disperse abrasive particles that are used for CMP application, several disper-\nsants have been investigated. Surfactants such as cetrimonium bromide (CTAB)\nand sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) have been investigated for silica slurries\n(Bu and Moudgil, 2007; Basim et al., 2003). Basim et al. reported that adsorbed\nCTAB on the silica abrasive provides a strong repulsive force between abrasives,\nleading to stable slurry (Basim et al., 2003). However, it also prevents direct contact\nbetween silica abrasives and the oxide ﬁlm, resulting in a decrease in the friction\nforce during polishing (Figure 11.4). Since the removal of material by silica abrasive\nis mechanically dominant, the decrease in the friction force inevitably leads to a\nlower material RR (MRR).\n\nVarious dispersants have been used to disperse ceria abrasive in aqueous media.\nPAA has been widely used to disperse ceria abrasive in CMP (Sehgal et al., 2005;\n\nLangmuir model\n\nFreundlich model\n\n)\n2\nm\n/\ng\nm\n\n(\n\ne\n\nQ\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\ne (mg/L)\n\nC\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFigure 11.3 Langmuir and Freundlich plot adsorption isotherm of PAA on ceria surface.\n\n \n\f278\n\nAdvances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\n\n)\n\nN\n\n(\ne\nc\nr\no\nf\nn\no\ni\nt\nc\ni\nr\nF\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n10000\n\n8000\n\n6000\n\n4000\n\n2000\n\n0\n\nM\na\nt\ne\nr\ni\na\n\nl\n\nr\ne\nm\no\nv\na\n\nl\n\nr\na\nt\ne\n(\n\n/\n\nÅ\nm\nn\n)\n\ni\n\nBaseline\nW/O salt\n\nBaseline\nW salt\n\n140 mM\nC8TAB\n\n68 mM\nC10TAB\n\n32 mM\nC12TAB\n\nFigure 11.4 In situ friction force and material removal rate responses of the baseline slurries\n(12 wt%, 2.0 mm primary particle size) and the slurries containing various concentration of\nCTAB in the presence of 0.6 M NaCl at pH 10.5.\nBasim et al. (2003).\n\nPettersson et al., 2000). PAA, an anionic surfactant, can adsorb on the highly posi-\ntively charged ceria surface by the attractive electrostatic force. Carboxylic (eCOOH)\ngroups of PAA adsorbed on the ceria surface are deprotonated to negatively charged\ncarboxylate (eCOO(cid:2)) groups above their pKa of 4.5, which improves the dispersion\nstability through an increase in repulsive force between abrasives. The ceria abrasives\nchemically remove the materials through interaction between active sites on surface\nand ﬁlm whereas silica abrasives mechanically remove the material (Wang et al.,\n2007; Dandu et al., 2011). For this reason, a signiﬁcant decrease in MRR is not\nobserved because of the PAA adsorbed on the abrasive surface. Kim et al. proposed\nthat the coadsorption of poly(methyl methacrylate) and hydrogen citrate on the ceria\nsurface can increase the repulsive force between abrasives, which improves dispersion\nstability (Kim et al., 2010). Figure 11.5 shows SiO2 MRR and within-wafer nonunifor-\nmity (WIWNU) during STI CMP. The results show that the improved dispersion sta-\nbility leads to an increase in SiO2 MRR and improved uniformity. Also, the number of\nresidual abrasive particles is signiﬁcantly decreased because of the increase in repul-\nsive force between the abrasives and the ﬁlm.\n\nThere are several reports that show highly active Ce3þ on a ceria surface has inﬂu-\nence on SiO2 MRR (Dandu et al., 2010; Kelsall, 1998). Dandu et al. identiﬁed through\nUV-visible spectroscopy that several additives (arginine, ornithine, and lysine) can\ninteract with Ce3þ on the ceria surface (Dandu et al., 2010, 2011). These additives\ncan block the Ce3þ on the abrasive surface by forming CeeOeSi bondings during\nSiO2 polishing, leading to a signiﬁcant decrease in MRR. Thus, dispersants should\nbe chosen by considering their chemical interaction with abrasives.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fPreparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)\n\n279\n\n(a)\n\n3000\n\ni\n\n)\nn\nm\nÅ\n\n/\n\n(\ne\nt\na\nr\n\nl\n\na\nv\no\nm\ne\nr\n\nS\nO\nE\nT\nE\nP\n\n2800\n\n2600\n\n2400\n\n2200\n\n–100\n\nCeria with PMMA\n\nw/o Hydrogen citrate\n0.5 wt% Hydrogen citrate\n1.0 wt% Hydrogen citrate\n2.0 wt% Hydrogen citrate\n\n–50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nPosition (mm)\n\n(b)\n\n1.50\n\n)\n\n%\n\n(\n\nU\nN\nW\nW\n\nI\n\n1.25\n\n1.00\n\n0.75\n\n0.50\n\n0.25\n\n0.00\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\nHydrogen citrate concentration (wt%)\n\nFigure 11.5 (a) Removal rate trends along radius of SiO2 ﬁlm and (b) WIWNU of SiO2 ﬁlm on\nSTI CMP ﬁeld evaluation.\nKim et al. (2010).\n\n11.2.3 Passivation agents for high selectivity\nPassivation agents are used for selective removal of a speciﬁc material among various\nmaterials during CMP. In STI CMP, polishing is stopped on the Si3N4 ﬁlm after the\nstep height structure of SiO2 is planarized. In the absence of passivation agents, erosion\nof Si3N4 ﬁlm, which has a direct inﬂuence on device yield, can occur. Generally, an\nanionic surfactant such as PAA has been widely used as a passivation agent for obtain-\ning high polish rate selectivity between SiO2 and Si3N4 (Park et al., 2003; Kim et al.,\n2008). PAA can preferentially absorb on the highly positively charged Si3N4 surface\nthrough the attractive electrostatic force (Hackley, 1997). This PAA adsorption layer\nprevents the abrasive from polishing the Si3N4 ﬁlm, resulting in high polish rate selec-\ntivity between SiO2 and Si3N4. Kim et al. controlled the conformation of adsorbed\nPAA on the Si3N4 ﬁlm with the addition of KNO3 (Kim et al., 2008). As shown in\nFigure 11.6, they observed that the adsorbed PAA layer on Si3N4 ﬁlm is denser\nwith an increase in KNO3 concentration. It is attributed to the charge screening of\nPAA by potassium ions. The densely adsorbed PAA layer on Si3N4 ﬁlm, formed at\nhigh ionic strength, prevents the ceria abrasives from polishing the Si3N4 ﬁlm, which\ndecreases the RR of Si3N4 ﬁlm from 72 to 61 Å/min, resulting in increased polishing\nrate selectivity between SiO2 and Si3N4.\n\nPenta et al. investigated four anionic surfactants with different functional groups as\npassivation agents for high selectivity in STI CMP (Penta et al., 2013a). Figure 11.7\nshows the RRs of SiO2 and Si3N4 in the presence of four different anionic surfactants.\nAll anionic surfactants can form the bilayer on Si3N4 ﬁlm below the isoelectric point of\nSi3N4. A monolayer is formed through electrostatic interaction between SiO2 and\nSi3N4, followed by a secondary layer through hydrophobic interaction between the\nsurfactant tails. These adsorption layers suppress the Si3N4 MRR during polishing,\nleading to high polishing rate selectivity between SiO2 and Si3N4. Contrary to these\nsurfactants, the ionic salt K2SO4 adsorbs only weakly on the Si3N4 ﬁlm, and cannot\nsuppress the Si3N4 MRR.\n\n \n \n \n \n\f280\n\nAdvances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\n\n0.12\n\n0.10\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n)\n2\nm\n/\ng\nm\n\n(\n\nt\nn\nu\no\nm\na\nd\ne\nb\nr\no\ns\nd\nA\n\nw/o KNO3\n0.2M KNO3\n0.4M KNO3\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\nResidual concentration (g/dL)\n\nFigure 11.6 Adsorption isotherms for PAA as a function of ionic strength on Si3N4 at pH 6.5.\nKim et al. (2008).\n\nRecently, various amino acids also have been investigated as passivation agents in\nSTI CMP (Penta et al., 2013b; Veera et al., 2009). Penta et al. reported that amino\nacids, having both an amine group and a carboxyl group, can suppress the removal\nof Si3N4 through formation of a hydrogen bond between the protonated amino group\nof the amino acid and the nitrogen atoms on the Si3N4. The adsorption of amino acids\non the Si3N4 can prevent the hydrolysis of the Si3N4. The removal of Si3N4 is signif-\nicantly suppressed. In contrast with the Si3N4 ﬁlm, amino acids on the SiO2 ﬁlm are\nweakly bound, and it can be easily removed by abrasives during polishing. As a result,\nthe high polishing rate selectivity between SiO2 and Si3N4 is shown. Since these amino\nacids are sensitive to a change of pH, they exhibit an “on/off” behavior on the Si3N4\npassivation as a function of pH. These characteristics of amino acids can be applied to\nformulate CMP slurries for next-generation devices that include new materials and\ncomplex structures.\n\nIn NAND ﬂash memory beyond 60 nm, the self-aligned poly-Si ﬂoating gates are\nconstructed without the deposition of Si3N4. Thus, polishing rate selectivity between\nSiO2 and poly-Si plays a key role in STI CMP for NAND ﬂash. Hydrophobic surfac-\ntants that can preferentially adsorb on poly-Si ﬁlm have been investigated as passiv-\nation agents for achieving high selectivity between SiO2 and poly-Si. The\nselectivity can be controlled through their different surface energies. Poly-Si ﬁlm\nhas a lower surface energy than an SiO2 ﬁlm, and this difference enables preferential\nadsorption of passivation agents on poly-Si ﬁlm. This passivation layer prevents the\nabrasive from polishing poly-Si ﬁlm, resulting in high polish rate selectivity. Lee\net al. studied the effects of various nonionic surfactants on selectivity between SiO2\nand poly-Si in STI CMP for NAND ﬂash (Lee et al., 2002). As shown in Figure 11.8,\nthey reported that the selectivity between SiO2 and poly-Si is signiﬁcantly correlated\n\n \n \n\fPreparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)\n\n281\n\n(a)\n\n120\n\n100\n\ni\n\n)\nn\nm\nm\nn\n(\n\n/\n\nR\nR\n2\nO\nS\n\ni\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n60\n\ni\n\n)\nn\nm\nm\nn\n(\n\n/\n\nR\nR\n4\nN\n3\ni\nS\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.25% K2SO4\nNo additive\n0.15% SLS\n0.15% DP\n0.15% DBSA\n0.25% SDS\n\n3\n\n5\n\n7\n\n9\n\n11\n\npH\n\n0.25% K2SO4\nNo additive\n0.15% SLS\n0.15% DP\n0.15% DBSA\n0.25% SDS\n\n3\n\n5\n\npH\n\n7\n\n9\n\n11\n\nFigure 11.7 Removal rates of (a) SiO2 and (b) Si3N4 with addition of anionic surfactants.\nPenta et al.

With the addition of a suitable oxidizer, a metal can form an oxide layer\non its surface, which can be easily removed during CMP.

However, it can form a\nthick and porous oxide layer with poor surface quality caused by the dissolution\nand oxidation reactions of W (Lim et al., 2013).\n\nFe ions catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 into the hydroxyl radicals (∙OH),\npowerful oxidants, through the Fenton reaction.

However, with the\naddition of Fe(NO3)3, the polarization curves of W ﬁlm show anodic oxidation\nbehavior. With an increase in Fe(NO3)3 concentrations, current density is shifted to\na lower value. It means that the dissolution of the W ﬁlm is reduced as a result of\nthe formation of a denser oxidation layer.\n\nVarious metal salts (Al, Ru, Ce, Co, Mn, Cu, and Cr), which have multiple redox states,\nalso decompose H2O2 into $OH through a Fenton-like reaction (Bokare and Choi, 2014).\nHowever, Fe ions have generally been used as a catalyst to decompose H2O2 into $OH\nbecause of (1) high abundance, (2) an environmentally friendly nature, (3) low toxicity,\n(4) a highly reactive redox cycle between Fe2þ\n\n, and (5) low cost.\n\nand Fe3þ\n\nRecently, CMP slurries for inactive materials such as ruthenium (Ru) and silicon\ncarbide (SiC) have been proposed for new applications (Cui et al., 2013; Kurokawa\net al., 2013). Several researchers are studying various oxidizers for inactive materials\nCMP. Cui et al. reported that Ru has a remarkable MRR with NaIO4 and NaClO\nbecause of the appropriate energy barrier between the Ru/RuO2 ﬁlm and the oxidizer.\nKurokawa et al. found that a mixture of N2 and O2 gases as well as KMnO4 can in-\ncrease SiC MRR. In conclusion, choice of suitable oxidizers is very important to\nachieve the improved CMP performances such as high MRR, high selectivity, unifor-\nmity, and low defects.\n\n11.2.5 Inhibitors\n\nIn order to obtain the high MRR, several CMP processes may be performed under high\ndissolution rate of metal ﬁlm. However, they inevitably lead to problems such as poor\nsurface quality, generation of pits, and high localized etching. To solve these problems\n\n \n \n \n\f284\n\nAdvances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\n\nin Cu CMP, benzotriazole (BTA) or its several derivatives have been used as a corro-\nsion inhibitor (Ein-Eli et al., 2003; Du et al., 2004). Notoya et al. studied the formation\nof various CueBTA complexes depending on the pH (Notoya and Poling, 1976). They\nreported the highest corrosion inhibition of Cu at pH 6. At acidic pH, BTA exists as a\nprotonated species, making it difﬁcult to form the complexes with positively charged\nCu ﬁlm because of the repulsive force. Above pH 6, highly soluble Cu2þ ions can be\nprecipitated in the form of Cu(OH)2 and others.\n\nSurfactants such as CTAB, ammonium dodecyl sulfate, and SDS were also inves-\ntigated as corrosion inhibitors for Cu ﬁlm. However, these surfactants may cause poor\nslurry stability and insufﬁcient corrosion inhibition. Among various corrosion inhibi-\ntors reported in the literature, BTA is still the most efﬁcient corrosion inhibitor.\nAlthough an addition of a corrosion inhibitor causes a decrease in MRR by preventing\nthe dissolution of Cu ﬁlm, it is one of essential components of high planarization and\nimproved surface quality.\n\n11.3 Characterizations of slurry for CMP\n\nThe characteristics of slurry such as abrasive particle size and distribution, surface\nchemistry, dispersion stability, and rheological behavior are determined by the com-\nplex interaction between its components, and have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on CMP\nperformances.\n\nAmong various characteristics of the slurry, abrasive particle size has signiﬁcant in-\nﬂuence on MRR. There are two models, contact area model and indentation volume\nmodel, to explain it. At the small abrasive particle, the contact area model is dominant.\nAs abrasive size increases, the indentation volume model becomes more appropriate\n(Basim et al., 2000). According to Cook’s hypothesis, the active sites on the abrasive\nsurface also play a key role in MRR. These active sites are inﬂuenced by various phys-\nicochemical conditions including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration.\nRheological behavior of CMP slurries is also important because their mass transport\non the pad can effect three-body (slurryepadewafer) interaction. Hence, it is very\nimportant to understand the characteristics of slurry because they have signiﬁcant in-\nﬂuence on CMP performances.\n\n11.3.1 Abrasive characteristics: size and concentration\nAbrasives in the size range 30e300 nm (aggregated size) have been used for polishing.\nHowever, the effect of abrasive size on CMP performance remains contradictory\n(Figure 11.10). Bielmann et al. reported that the removal mechanism of W ﬁlm is\nrelated to the\nshown in\nFigure 11.10(a), the W MRR is increased with a decrease in abrasive size (Bielmann\net al., 1999). MRR based on the contact area model is expressed as follows (Basim\net al., 2000):\n\narea between abrasive\n\nand wafer.

When the CMP conditions and solid concen-\ntration are ﬁxed, the MRR is increased with a decrease in abrasive size.\n\nHowever, others suggest the opposite conclusions (Tamboli et al., 2004; Lei\nand Luo, 2004). Tamboli et al. suggested that the MRR is increased with an\ntantalum and tetra-ethyl ortho-silicate\nincrease in abrasive size in CMP for\n(Tamboli et al., 2004). As shown in Figure 11.10(b), Lei et al. also showed that\nlarger abrasive size leads to an increase in MRR for polishing hard disk substrate\n\n(a)\n\n7\n\ni\n\n)\nn\nm\nm\nn\n(\n\n/\n\n)\ne\nt\na\nr\n\nl\n\na\nv\no\nm\ne\nr\n(\nn\nI\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n–1.8 –1.5 –1.2 –0.9 –0.6 –0.3 0.0 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.6 2.1 2.4\nIn (median particle size) (μm)\n\n(b) 22\n\n19\n\n16\n\n)\n\nm\nn\n4\n0\n\n.\n0\n×\n(\n\nt\n\nn\nu\no\nm\na\n\nl\n\na\nv\no\nm\ne\nr\n\nl\n\na\ni\nr\ne\n\nt\n\na\nM\n\n13\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nParticle average diameter (nm)\n\nFigure 11.10 Effect of the particle size on MRR: (a) W MRR as a function of particle size\nfor different solids loading (Bielmann et al., 1999); (b) MRR for hard disk substrate as a function\nof particle diameter (Lei and Luo, 2004).\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f286\n\nAdvances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\n\n(Lei and Luo, 2004).

The indenta-\ntion volume of an abrasive particle into the wafer becomes larger because of an in-\ncrease in abrasive size, which can increase the MRR.\n\nThese opposite conclusions are because slurry formulation and material removal\nmechanisms are different depending on the types of materials to be polished. In any\ncase, the large abrasive sizes can produce the scratch defects on ﬁlms during CMP\n(Remsen et al., 2005, 2006). Since the number of maximum permissible defects is\ncontinually lowered with decreasing device dimensions, CMP slurries containing\nsmaller abrasive sizes have been investigated.\n\nThe concentrations as well as the size of the abrasives have an effect on MRR.\nThere are three distinct regions of MRR dependence on abrasive concentration (Lee\net al., 2009; Luo and Dornfeld, 2003) (Figure 11.11). First, MRR rapidly increases\nwith an increase in abrasive concentration, which indicates that chemical removal of\nmaterial is dominant at low concentrations. Second, as mechanical removal becomes\ndominant, MRR is proportional to the abrasive concentration. And third, the dominant\nmechanical effect is saturated because the contact area between abrasive and the wafer\nsurface is at a maximum. Although the MRR varied with the abrasive concentration\ndepending on the types of abrasives, ﬁlms, and additives, their trends are quite similar.\nIn practice, the silica slurries have high solids contents of 5e50 wt% whereas the ceria\nand alumina slurries have low solid contents (w5 wt%).\n\ni\n\n/\n\n)\nn\nm\nm\nn\n(\ne\n\nt\n\na\nr\n\nl\n\na\nv\no\nm\ne\nr\n\nl\n\na\ni\nr\ne\n\nt\n\na\nM\n\n200\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n–1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\nAbrasive concentration (wt%)\n\n5\n\n3\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFigure 11.11 MRR as a function of abrasive concentration.\nLee et al.

At the pHpzc, abrasive particles show zero zeta potential.\nThis insufﬁcient surface charge between abrasive particles decreases the energy barrier\nfor agglomeration, resulting in poor dispersion stability. Thus, it has to be formulated\nat pH < pHpzc or pH > pHpzc where abrasive particles have a highly charged surface.\nFigure 11.12 shows the electrokinetic behaviors of materials used in STI CMP (Kim\net al., 2003). The surface potentials of all materials are strongly dependent on the sus-\npension pH. The SiO2 shows negative charge above pHpzc 3. Its charge is slightly\ndecreased with an increase in pH above pH 9, which is attributed to the compression\nof the electrical double layer by dissolved Si ions (Paik et al., 2001). Si3N4 shows a\nnegative charge above pHpzc 6.5 by the formation of SiO(cid:2). In the pH range 3e6.5,\nSiO2 and Si3N4 ﬁlms show different surface charge.

With\nthe addition of anionic dispersants, ceria abrasive shows a highly negative charge in\nthe pH range 2.5e11.\n\nThe surface charges of ceria are different depending on their synthesis methods\n(Figure 11.13). Whereas solid-state ceria forms the hydroxyl groups in aqueous media,\nsolution-grown ceria inevitably contains large concentrations of nitrate ions that orig-\ninate from the precursor such as cerium nitrate (Nabavi et al., 1993). These nitrate ions\npreferentially adsorb on the surface during synthesis. For this reason, the pHpzc of\nsolid-state ceria and solution-grown ceria are observed at slightly different pH values,\n8.3 and 10.4, respectively. Adsorption of speciﬁc ions on the abrasive surface can\nchange the surface charge as a function of pH, which modiﬁes their CMP perfor-\nmances. This will be discussed in Section 3.3.3.\n\nIn contrast with STI CMP slurries, metal CMP slurries have higher ionic strength\nbecause of the addition of oxidizer, inhibitors, and complexing agents. At high ionic\nstrength, counter ions are attracted to the charged interface and form a diffuse ion\n“cloud” adjacent to the particle surface. Counter ions surrounding the interface of par-\nticles reduce the surface charge of the particles through charge screening, which causes\nagglomeration and settling. Choi et al. studied the effect of ionic strength on CMP\n(Choi et al., 2004). They observed agglomerations of particle at high ionic strength\nbecause surface charge is decreased by the charge screening. Although the agglomer-\nated particles can increase the MRR because of their larger size, they cause signiﬁcant\nsurface damages on ﬁlm during polishing.\n\nFigure 11.14 shows the addition of the various surfactants such as CPC (cationic\nsurfactant), SDS (anionic surfactant), and Triton X-100 (nonionic surfactant) in\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n–0.2\n\n–0.4\n\n)\n\n/\n\nV\nM\n*\na\nP\nm\n\n(\n\nA\nS\nE\n\nSolid-state ceria\nSolution-grown ceria\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\npH\n\nFigure 11.13 Electrokinetic behaviors of solid-state and solution-grown ceria as a function\nof pH.\nSeo et al.

This surfactant structure is not affected by ionic\nstrength.\n\n11.3.3 Surface chemistry\n\nIn an aqueous media, abrasive particles are sensitive to the changes in their physico-\nchemical conditions including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration,\nwhich have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on their surface chemistry. Hence, an understanding\nof the surface chemistry of the abrasive particles is essential for their CMP application.\nSeo et al. have identiﬁed through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) that\nsurface functional groups of ceria abrasive varied with synthesis methods (Seo et al.,\n2014). The eOH groups on the ceria surface can be generated by dissociation reaction\nof H2O on the defect site. In general, solid-state ceria forms the eOH groups in\naqueous media. However, solution-grown ceria inevitably contains large concentra-\ntions of nitrate ions, which originate from the precursor such as cerium nitrate. These\nnitrate ions were covalently bound on the surface during synthesis, which have an in-\nﬂuence on CMP performance. Seo et al. experimentally and theoretically demonstrated\nthe effect of surface functional groups such as eNO3 and eOH groups on CMP per-\nformance (Seo et al., 2014). Experimental results derived from adsorption isotherms of\nsilicate ions on ceria surface show the eNO3 group has a much higher afﬁnity with\nsilicate than the eOH group. Theoretical analysis using density functional theory\ncalculation shows that the binding energy of the NO3-ceria ((cid:2)4.383 eV) on the\nSiO2 surface is much higher than that of the OH-ceria ((cid:2)3.813 eV) (Figure 11.16).\nAs shown in Figure 11.17, the CMP result shows that the SiO2 RR of NO3-ceria\n(360 nm/min) is higher than that of OH-ceria (274 nm/min). These results imply\nthat surface functional groups of particle surface have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on\nCMP performance.\n\nThe synthesis methods as well as pH of the reaction medium have signiﬁcant inﬂu-\nence on the surface chemistry of the synthesized materials. Wu et al. reported that the\npH of a reaction medium has an inﬂuence on the crystallization of ceria under hydro-\nthermal methods (Wu et al., 2002). The result showed that grain growth in acidic me-\ndium is faster due to the dissolution rate of precursor than that in alkaline medium.\nCeria, synthesized in an acidic medium, has higher Ce3þ concentrations on the surface\nthan those synthesized in an alkaline medium. Presumable, it shows high SiO2 MRR\ncaused by the high Ce3þ concentrations.\n\nAbrasive sizes less than 100 nm are extremely sensitive to changes in their\nphysico-chemical environments because of the higher surface energy compared to\nlarger abrasives. The formation of an oxygen vacancy leaves electrons at the surface,\nwhich reduces Ce4þ to Ce3þ ions (Tsunekawa et al., 1999). Figure 11.18 shows lat-\ntice parameter as a function of size of ceria. Tsunekawa et al. found through the elec-\ntron diffraction patterns that small size ceria has higher Ce3þ concentrations\ncompared to bulk ceria. They reported that it is attributed to the increased surface-\nto-volume ratio of the small particle.\n\n\fPreparation and characterization of slurry for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)\n\n291\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nInitial state\nE\nb = 0.0 eV\n\n(001) SiO2\n\nInitial state\nE\nb = 0.0 eV\n\n(001) SiO2\n\nIntermediate state\nb = –2.865 eV\n\nE\n\nFinal state\nb = –3.813 eV\n\nE\n\nFinal state\nE\nb = –4.384 eV\n\nH\n\nO\n\nN\n\nCe\n\nSi\n\nFigure 11.16 Fully optimized structures on the reaction of functionalized ceria adsorption\non the SiO2 (001) surface: (a) OH-ceria and (b) NO3-ceria.

Fumed silica has a lower total hydroxyl content\n(2.8 OH/nm2) and a higher portion of isolated silanol than colloidal silica (4.5 OH/\nnm2). These reactive sites on the surface produce $OH with H2O2 or water according\nto a Fenton-like reaction (Fubini and Hubbard, 2003). The reactivity between silica\nand H2O2 is very important because H2O2 has been widely used as oxidants for metal\nslurries.\n\nSilica abrasives show different surface chemistry as the abrasive size decreases.\nKamiya et al. studied the effect of silica size on surface silanol structure through\nFTIR (Kamiya et al., 2000). For relatively small particles (<10 nm in diameter), the\nisolated silanol is observed. However, as the particle diameter increased to >30 nm,\nthe surface density of the isolated silanol decreased, and hydrogen-bonded silanol\ngroups are Increased due to the strong hydration force between the silanols. These\nsize-dependent differences of surface chemistry of silica can lead to a variation of sur-\nface charge on silica (Puddu and Perry, 2014) (Figure 11.20). With an increase in the\nparticle size, an increase in surface charge is observed. Although there is no report that\nthe effect of surface chemistry varied with particle size on CMP performance, under-\nstanding the surface chemistry of abrasive particles is very important because it has a\nsigniﬁcant inﬂuence on CMP performance.\n\n \n\f294\n\nAdvances in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP)\n\nFigure 11.20 Zeta potential of silica nanoparticles as a function of pH.\nPuddu and Perry (2014).\n\n11.3.4 Rheological behavior\n\nDuring polishing, CMP slurries are transported into the pores of the polishing pad by\nhigh speed rotation. These slurries form a liquid ﬁlm between the polishing pad and the\nwafer, which determines the contact regime between them. Figure 11.21 is the coefﬁ-\ncient of friction (COF) as a function of a lubrication parameter (hV/P), which is known\nas the Stribeck curve; it shows three distinct regions: boundary lubrication, mixed\nlubrication, and hydrodynamic lubrication (Philipossian and Olsen, 2003). Boundary\nlubrication is dominated by solidesolid contact. In this regime, the COF shows a high\nvalue because of direct contact between the solid surfaces. However, the COF is not\n\nμ\n\n(II) Mixed\nlubrication\n\nh\n\nh\n\n(I) Boundary\nlubrication\n\n(III) Hydrodynamic\nlubrication\n\n)\nh\n(\n\ns\ns\ne\nn\nk\nc\nh\n\ni\n\nt\n\nm\n\nl\ni\n\nF\n\n)\nµ\n(\n\nt\n\ni\n\nn\ne\nc\ni\nf\nf\n\ne\no\nc\nn\no\n\ni\nt\nc\ni\nr\nF\n\nVelocity x viscosity\n\nLoad\nFigure 11.21 Friction coefﬁcient plotted as a function of ﬂuid viscosity and shear velocity\ndivided by load (Stribeck curve) with corresponding lubrication ﬁlm thickness.\nColes et al.

The second re-\ngion is known as partial lubrication, where the liquid ﬁlm formed between the pad and\nwafer is more important and the COF decreases with an increase in the lubrication\nparameter. The third region is hydrodynamic lubrication, which shows the low COF\nvalue. The pad and wafer are fully separated because of the formation of thick liquid\nﬁlm. The COF increases slightly with an increase in the lubrication parameter. Mul-\nlany and Byrne experimentally and theoretically investigated the effect of slurry vis-\ncosity on MRR (Mullany and Byrne, 2003). As viscosity is increased while other\nvariables such as velocity and pressure were kept constant, the thickness of liquid\nﬁlm is greater (Figure 11.22(a)). This thick liquid ﬁlm decreases the COF value, result-\ning in a decrease in MRR (Figure 11.22(b)). The COF against the lubrication param-\neter shows a downward slope. Thus, they suggested that the experiment was processed\nin the partial lubrication region.\n\n11.4 Conclusion\n\nIn this chapter, we described the role of each component in CMP slurry, and discussed\nthe characterization of slurries for CMP. Since CMP was developed in the 1980s,\nmany researchers have investigated CMP slurries in a variety of ways. However, there\nis still a need to understand more profoundly how the slurry characteristics affect CMP\nperformance. These issues can be solved through a fundamental study of powder tech-\nnology, surface chemistry, and colloidal chemistry.\n\nReferences\n\nAsakura, S., Oosawa, F., 1954.
