Introduction\n\nCerium  dioxide  is  one  of  the  most  important  rare-earth\noxide,  of  which  application  ﬁelds  include  industrial  catalysts\n[1,2],  solid  oxide  fuel  cells  (SOFC)  [3,4],  polishing  abrasive\n[5,6]  and  other  ﬁelds.  Especially,  CeO2 polishing  abrasive  for\nSTI-CMP  (Shallow  Trench  Isolation  Chemical  Mechanical\nPolishing)  has  been  received  widely  attention  in  recent  years\ndue \nits  excellent  selectivity  and  efﬁciency.  To  satisfy\npolishing  requirements,  a  variety  of  cerium  oxide  synthesis\nmethods  have  been  extensively  studied  to  increase  cerium\ndioxide  performance  in  STI-CMP  process,  such  as  precipita-\ntion,  sol–gel,  hydrothermal,  physical  chemistry,  and  high-\nenergy  dispersion.\n\nto \n\nAs  we  known,  the  commercial  abrasive  particles  are  usually\nprepared  by  means  of  calcination,  gas  combustion  or  high-\nenergy  ball  milling  dispersion,  easily  leading  to  irregular  shape,\nsevere  agglomeration,  uneven  distribution  of  particles.  These\ndisadvantages  resulted  in  the  scratches  and  defects  of  polished\nsurface,  and  limited  the  CeO2 abrasive  further  application  in  the\ndecreasing  feature  size  of  integrated  circuits  in  the  semi-\nconductor  industry.\n\nIn \n\nto  replace  CeO2-calcinated\nthis  paper,  we  proposed \nabrasive  with  CeO2-colloid  abrasive \nreduce\npolishing  defects.  Otherwise,  the  synthesized  colloids  should\nbe  crystalline  ceria  to  keep  its  high  polishing  selectivity.\n\nin  order \n\nto \n\n2.  Experimental\n\nincreased \n\nThe  synthesis  process  was  similar  to  the  reference  [7,8].  The\ndetails  were  described  as  follows  (Fig.  1):  cerium  source\nCe(NO3)3(cid:2)6H2O,  buffer  CO(NH2)2 and  dispersant  PVP  were\ndissolved  into  a  certain  amount  of  deionized  water  with  a\nmagnetic  stirrer.  The \nthe  mixture  solution\ntemperature  of \ngradually \nset\nto \nroom \nfrom \ntemperature,  and  the  solution  should  be  kept  stirring  for  1  h.\nThen,  an  appropriate  amount  of  ammonia  was  added  dropwise\nwith  a  burette.  The  reaction  quickly  happened  within  a  few\nseconds,  and  the  solution  color  underwent  obviously  change  in\nfew  hours.  The  phenomenon  of  color  change  was  believed  to  be\ncorrelated  with  the  chemical  changes.  As  the  color  of  reaction\nsolution  turned  from  purple  into  pale  yellow,  the  Ce3+ happened\nto  be  oxidized  into  Ce4+ by  O2 under  air  atmosphere.  The  possible\nchemical  reaction  is  stated  as  the  following  formulas  [9]:\n\ntemperature \n\nthe \n\n*  Corresponding  author.

Results  and  discussion\n\nIn  order  to  conﬁrm  the  possible  compound  in  the  powder\nsample  for  researching  the  actual  reaction  process,  the  sample\nwas  dried  at  room  temperature  in  the  semi-closed  crucible  for\nseveral  days.  The  dried  powder  showed  pale  yellow,  as  the  same\ncolor  as  the  sol.  Fig.  2  shows  the  TG–DSC  curves  of  the  dried\npowder.\n\nThe  TG–DSC  patterns  (in  Fig.  2)  showed \n\nthe  thermal\nbehavior  from  room  temperature  up  to  500  8C.  The  mass  loss\ncan  be  divided  into  four  stages:  The  weight  loss  below  140  8C\n\nFig.  5.

Fig.  6  shows  the  TEM  images  of  two  kinds\nof  cerium  concentration  samples.  It  could  be  found  that  each\ncolloid  was  consisted  of  several  10-nm-size  crystal  particles,\nand  ceria  colloids  were  not  monodispersed  actually.  The  CeO2\ncolloids  obtained  from  the  solution  of  0.05  mol  L(cid:3)1 cerium  (a)\npossessed  a  better  dispersion  performance \nthat  of\n\nthan \n\nwas  due  to  the  removal  of  physisorbed  water.  Decomposition  of\nthe  structural  water  was  in  between  140  8C  and  215  8C.  The\nloss  from  215  8C  to  305  8C  was  attributed  to  the\nweight \ndecomposition  of  a  side  product  of  cerium  oxycarbonate  [7],\ncorresponding  to  a  sharp  exothermic  peak  at  291  8C  in  the  DTA\ncurve.  The  exothermic  peak  around  450  8C  might  be  caused  by\nthe  oxidation  of  cerium  compound.  So,  it  could  be  concluded\nthat  the  synthesized  product  contained  not  only  ceria  but  also\nsome  other  materials.\n\nAs  we  know,  the  crystal  structure  of  pure  ceria  is  a  face-\ncentered  cubic  structure,  grouped  into  the  calcium  ﬂuoride\n(CaF2)  structural  type  with  space  group  Fm3m.  The  XRD\npattern  of  the  dried  ceria  colloids  (Fig.  3)  showed  a  good\nagreement  with  literature  data  (JCPDS  No.  34-0394).  The  main\nBragg  peaks  with  Miller  indices  (1  1  1),  (2  0  0),  (2  2  0),  (3  1  1),\n(2  2  2),  and  (4  0  0)  could  be  found  clearly.  The  pure  crystallized\nceria  could  be  obtained  at  lower  temperature.\n\nFig.  4  depicts  the  XPS  spectrum  of  the  CeO2 nanoparticles.\nPeaks  of  Ce  3d  and  O  1s  proved  the  existence  of  cerium  oxide.\nCe  3d  binding  energy  (BE)  peaks  were  consistent  with  that  of\nCe4+ ions.  The  band  at  918.1  eV  should  be  one  of  the  3d104f0\nstate  of  the  Ce4+ ions  [10,11],  compared  with  the  band  of\n916.5  eV  BE  in  the  reference  [12],  the  upward  shift  of  binding\nenergy  value  may  be  due  to  smaller  particle  size.  Here,  the\nsoftware  of  XPSPEAK41  was  used  to  mark  and  ﬁt  the  Ce  3d\npeaks.The  aqueous  solution  with  concentration  of  0.1  mol  L(cid:3)1\ncerium  was  adopted  for  synthesis  of  ceria  colloids.  The  content\nof  PVP  was  30  g  L(cid:3)1.  The  TEM  images  of  ceria  colloids\nsynthesized  at  different  temperatures  for  72  h  are  shown  in\nFig.  5.  Obviously,  the  sample  synthesized  at  25  8C  had  severe\ncolloid  agglomeration \nthe  sample\nsynthesized  at  65  8C  (Fig.  5(b))  indicated  a  better  dispersing\nbehavior.  Lower  temperature  might  restrain  the  dispersion\neffect  of  PVP  so  that  leaded  to  a  bad  dispersion  performance.  It\nmeans  that  the  dispersion  effect  of  PVP  requires  a  proper\ntemperature.\n\n(Fig.  5(a)).  However, \n\nGenerally,  the  content  of  ceria  colloids  in  the  solution\ndepends  on \nin  reaction\nthe  concentration  of  cerium  salt \nprecursor.  In  the  study,  the  samples  with  different  cerium\ncontents  were  synthesized  to  conﬁrm  the  limit  concentration  of\nceria  hydrosol.  The  experimental  results  shown:  with  increas-\ning  concentration  of  cerium \nthe\nprecipitation  started  to  appear  gradually.  When  the  concentra-\ntion  of  cerium  reached  up  to  0.2  mol  L(cid:3)1,  the  colloids  in  the\n\nsolution, \n\nsalt \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nFig.  7.

The  experimental  facts  indicated  the\nstability  of  ceria  hydrosol  is  relative  to  the  concentration  of\ncerium  salt.\n\nFig.  7(a)–(c)  shows  TEM  images  of  the  samples  prepared  at\ndifferent  reaction  times.  It  could  be  seen  that  the  effect  of\nreaction  time  on  crystallinity  of  ceria  is  obvious.  With  increase\nof  reaction  time,  the  reciprocal  lattice  of  patterns  became  more\nand  more  evident,  which  proved  a  well-crystallized  ceria.  Size\nof  the  ceria  colloids  not  changed  obviously  with  increase  of\nreaction  time.\n\nCeria  particles  are  easy  to  form  aggregation.  To  verify  the\nstability  of  cerium  oxide  hydrosol,  the  sample  stored  three\nmonths  was  measured  by  TEM.  The  colloids  had  no  signiﬁcant\nfurther  agglomeration  compared  with  fresh  sample  (similar  to\nFig.  7).  The  hydrosol  is  stable  enough  for  application.\n\n4.  Conclusions\n\nWell-dispersed  ceria  hydrosol  was  obtained  via  the  sol–gel\nprocess  at  65  8C.  The  ceria  colloids  possessed  face-centered\ncubic  CaF2 structure.  The  grain  size  is  in  the  range  of  several\nnanometers  to  more  than  10  nm.  The  hydrosol  also  exhibited  a\ngood  aging  stability  in  three  months.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]  S.
