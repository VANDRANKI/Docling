Three slurry samples were prepared\nbased on a 1.0 wt.% abrasive concentration with different sizes of ceria particles. The step height and dishing reduction were investigated as a\nfunction of the polishing time with pattern wafers in prepared slurries. The reduction in thickness as a function of the polishing time varied\nbetween the different slurries. The dependence of the step height reduction of the patterned wafer on the polishing time showed non-linear\nbehavior in all of the tested slurries. The amount of dishing also varied with the type of slurry. The changes in the cross-sectional profiles of the\noxide as a function of the polishing time were analyzed, in order to establish a dishing and step height reduction model depending on the\nabrasive size. The step height variation and dishing were varied with the size of the abrasive. The observed results were explained by the\ncontribution of inactive particles, which depended on relative size of the abrasives and the height of the remaining oxide layer.\nD 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\n\nShallow trench isolation (STI) has emerged as the\nprimary technique for advanced ultra large-scale integra-\ntion (ULSI) technologies [1,2]. STI improves the isolation\nand increases the device packing density. However, STI\nrequires a planarization process. Several issues associated\nwith chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) need to be\nsolved, since the requirements for STI planarization are\ninter-layer dielectric\nmuch more severe than those for\n(ILD) planarization [3]. STI structures consist of nitride\nand oxide deposition as shown in Fig. 1. Oxide remnants\nabove the silicon nitride, erosion and trench oxide dishing\nduring CMP process are frequently observed during STI\nplanarization as shown in Fig. 1b. These defects are\nundesirable, since they degrade the quality of the isolation\nand damage the edge of the silicon active area [4– 6].\n\n* Corresponding author.

The effect of the surface\nconditions and the hardness of the polishing pad and on\nthe planarization has previously been studied [7 –9]. Zhao\nand Shi also showed that\nlow down-force polishing\nprovides better planarization than high down-force STI –\nCMP [10]. The use of high selectivity slurries such as\nthe\nceria-based slurry that\npolishing at the nitride stop layer and reduce the amount of\ndishing was also reported [11 – 13]. Dishing and the\ngeneration of defects have remained an ongoing issue,\nimprovements in trench\nhowever, despite the significant\ndishing that were achieved recently through the use of high\nselectivity slurries. To improve the planarization of the STI\nprocess, it is necessary to understand in detail the nature of\nthe contact between the abrasive and the oxide layer.\nHowever,\nfew studies have been conducted in order\ninvestigate the effect of the abrasive size on the variation\nin the step height. In this study, the effect of abrasive size\non the variation in the oxide step height and the amount of\ndishing was examined, in order to provide guidelines for\n\nFig. 1 shows the typical SEM images of\n\nthe STI\nstructure. This pattern is prepared as follows. The isolation\nmask is prepared by depositing a 129 nm thick LPCVD (low\npressure chemical vapor deposited) nitride film on a 10 nm\nthick thermal pad. Following the photolithographic defini-\ntion of the active area, the nitride/oxide stack is etched and\n372 nm trenches are subsequently etched into the silicon\nsubstrate. After cleaning, a 10 nm sidewall oxidation step is\nperformed. Next, the trenches are refilled using 457 nm\nHDP (high density plasma)-CVD oxide. Specimens with\ndimensions of 30 (cid:1) 30 mm were diced from the 200 mm\nisolation pattern wafer. Each specimen contained a series of\nline patterns, which consisted of trenches with a width of 10\nAm and a patterned width of 10 Am. CMP was carried out by\nmeans of a rotary type CMP machine (LPG-15AF, Lap-\nmaster SFT Corp., Japan) using a polyurethane stack pad\n(IC1000/SUBA IV, Rodel). Three types of ceria-based\nslurry were used, in order to study the variation in the step\nheight with the abrasive size. The slurries were prepared by\nusing three different kinds of ceria abrasives as shown in\nTable 1. The abrasives were dispersed in deionized water.\nCommercial dispersant and anionic surfactant were added.\nThe solid loading of the abrasives and organic slurry pH\nwere fixed to 1 wt.% and 6.7, respectively. The polishing\nspeeds of both the table and the head were maintained at 40\n\nFig. 2.

Variation of dishing as a function of over-polishing time with three\ndifferent slurries.\n\nbeginning of the polishing process and then more rapidly as\nthree slurries. The initial\npolishing progresses for all\nremoval rate of the oxide film increases with increasing\nparticle size in the slurry. The transition from a slow to a\nrapid removal\nrate was unexpected, since the contact\npressure between the pad and the wafer would be expected\nto decrease as polishing progresses. This unique character-\nistic can be explained as follows. Fig. 5 shows a schematic\nmodel of the step height variation, which shows that the\naverage particle size is smaller than the scale of the oxide\nspace (the initial step height of the film is about 350 nm).\nTherefore, at the beginning of the polishing process (T0),\nthe abrasive particles could be trapped and inactive. The\nedge corner of the oxide step can be polished preferentially,\ndue to the concentration of the downward acting force. As\npolishing progresses (T1), the abrasives in the oxide space\nbecome active and can support this downward acting force.\nThe probability of direct contact occurring between the\noxide layer and the abrasive particles embedded in the pad\nincreases with decreasing step height, and this allows the\nremoval rate of the oxide to increase as planarization\nprogresses. The effect of the abrasive size on the step height\nvariation can be explained in a similar manner. The average\nsize of the abrasive particles in slurry A is the smallest and,\ntherefore, the possibility of them being trapped in the oxide\nspace and thus being inactive during polishing is the\ngreatest. In this case, the oxide removal rate is the lowest\nand the time to reach the transition to a fast removal rate is\nthe longest. The amount of dishing increases with increasing\nover-polishing time, as would be expected (Fig. 6). The\namount of dishing increases with increasing average\nabrasive size. The inaction of the abrasives trapped in the\noxide space during the initial period of polishing was\nconfirmed by the variation in the roughness (Fig. 7). In the\ncase of slurry A, the surface roughness of the down area\nafter polishing for 20 s remained at about the same level as\nthe roughness of the oxide without polishing. The roughness\nafter polishing decreased with increasing abrasive size.\nThese results confirm that the partial interactions between\nthe abrasive particles and the down area of the oxide\n\ndecrease with decreasing abrasive size and polishing time,\ndue to the increasing number of trapped and inactive\nparticles. Considering the effect of these inactive particles,\nthe roughness of the down area would be expected to vary\nsignificantly with the polishing time. The roughness of the\noxide was inversely proportional to the abrasive size but\nlinearly for polishing before the end-point but\nlinearly\nvaried with abrasive size for over-polishing. Variation of\nroughness with abrasive size after over-polishing matches\nwell with the dishing variation shown in Fig. 6.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nIn this study, the effect of the abrasive size on the step\nheight variation and amount of dishing during STI – CMP\nwas studied. The removal rate of the oxide varied with the\npolishing time and type of abrasive in the slurry. The unique\ncharacteristics of the step height variation associated with\nthe ceria-based slurries were explained by the contribution\nof the inactive particles, which depended on the height of\nthe remaining oxide layer. The amount of dishing increased\nas the particle size increased, due to the increasing\npenetration depth. The roughness of the oxide down area\nseemed to be well matched with the step height variation\nand the amount of dishing, which supports the proposed\nexplanation. This study suggests that the size of the abrasive\nis an important parameter involved in controlling the local\nplanarity in STI – CMP.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the Memory Research and\n\nDevelopment Division, Hynix Semiconductor Inc.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] P.
