CeO2  is  one  of  the  highly  refractory \noxides  and  is  difficult  to  sinter  to  a  high  density \nwithout  sintering  aids,  therefore  CeO2  needs  to  be \nproduced  as  a  fine  powder  for  good  sinterability.  Up \nto  now,  few  attempts  have  been  made  for  the \npreparation  of  fine  CeO2  particles.  Matijevic  and \nHsu  [2]  showed  that  the  crystalline  compound  of  a \nhydroxyl  carbonate  compound  (Ce20(CO3)2H20) \nwith  a  spherical  shape  was  precipitated  in  a  urea \nsolution  and  the  compound  was  converted  to  cubic \n[3] \nCeO2  with  calcination  at  400 °C.  Chu  et  al. \nstudied  the  sintering  of the  cerium-containing  parti- \ncles  obtained  from urea  solutions.  Chen  and  Chen  [4] \nreported  the  preparation  of fine  CeO2  powders  using \nthe  homogeneous  precipitation  method  and  a  hexa- \nmethylenetetramine  (HMT).  In  accordance  with  the \nhydrothermal  synthesis,  Tani  et  al.  [5]  studied  the \neffect  of mineralizers  on  the  crystallization  of  CeO2 \nunder  hydrothermal  conditions  at  500-600  °C  and \n100 MPa.  Zhou  and  Rahaman  [6]  investigated  the \nsintering  of  ultrafine  hydrothermally  synthesized \nCeO2  powders.  However,  the  factors  affecting  the \nhydrothermal  process  have  not  been  clarified. \n\nIn  the  present  study,  ultrafine  CeO2  powders  were \nsynthesized  in  the  presence  of  an  excess  amount  of \nammonia  in  an  autoclave  at  150-200 °C.  The  effects \nof  treatment  temperature, \ntreatment  time  and  the \nconcentration  of  the  starting  solution  on  the  crystal \ngrowth  of  CeO2  under  hydrothermal  conditions \nwere  investigated. \n\nin  a  stainless  steel \n\nThe  solutions  of  cerium(w)  sulphate  tetrahydrate, \nCe(SO4)2-4H20,  were  stirred  well  and  an  excess \namount  of  ammonia \nsolution  was  added.  The \nresulting  precipitate,  which  was  prepared  in  20 ml \nTeflon  bottles  without  separating \nthe  precipitate \nfrom  its  mother  liquor,  was  sealed  with  a  cap  and \nplaced \nlaboratory  autoclave \nvessel,  which  was  heat  treated  for  a  specific  time  at \n150-200 °C.  The  products  prepared  by  the  hydro- \nthermal  treatment  were  washed  with  distilled  water, \ndried  in  air  and  characterized  using  X-ray  diffrac- \ntometry  (XRD)  and  transmission  electron  micro- \nscopy  (TEM).  The  crystallite  sizes  of  the  phases \nwere  calculated  from  the  Scherrer  formula  using  the \n(220)  diffraction  peak  of  CeO2. \n\nThe  results  of  the  experiment  on  the  effect  of \ntreatment  temperature  on  the  hydrothermal  products \nare  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  XRD  patterns  show  all  of \nthe  major \nfluorite \nstructure  with  no  sign  of  an  amorphous  form.
