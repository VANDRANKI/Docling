Introduction\n\nOxides  of  rare  earth  elements  are  used  widely  in  the  catalyst\nindustry  to  improve  activity,  selectivity  and  thermal  stability.\nCerium  dioxide  (ceria,  CeO2)  has  been  widely  investigated  in\nrecent  years  since  it  is  a  promising  material  for  number  of\napplications  and \ntherefore,  holds  particular  signiﬁcance\namongst  the  rare  earth  oxides  [1,2].  For  example,  CeO2 is\nbecoming  an  important  material  constituent  in  various  ﬁelds  of\nmodern \ntechnology,  such  as  catalysis,  microelectronics,\noptoelectronics,  electrochemical  devices  and  ultraviolet\nblockers  [3–5].  Also,  the  ability  of  cerium  oxide  to  interact\nwith  phosphate  ester  bonds  of  biologically  relevant  molecules\nhas \ntheir  use  as  potential\ntherapeutics \n[6].  The  microstructure  dependent  physical\nproperties  have  been  studied  in  thin  ﬁlms  of  CeO2 [7,8].\nThe  shape  dependent  sensing  properties  of  CeO2 have  been\nreported  and  this  provides  a  new  application  of  CeO2 dendrites\n[9].  The  ultraﬁne  nm-sized  particles  of  CeO2 have  attracted\nmuch  attention  since  these  particles  often  exhibit  physical  and\nchemical  properties  that  are  signiﬁcantly  different  from  those\nof  bulk  materials  [10].  These  CeO2 ultraﬁne  ((cid:2)3  nm)  particles\n\nimplications \n\nimportant \n\nfor \n\n*  Corresponding  author.\n\nE-mail  addresses:  yadavtp@gmail.com,  t.yadav@liv.ac.uk  (T.P.

The  grain-size-dependent  electrical  con-\nductivity  of  cerium  oxide  has  been  analyzed  experimentally  as\nwell  as  theoretically  using  the  space  charge  model  for  ionic\nsolids \nspray\npyrolysis,  microwave  assisted  thermal  decomposition,  electro\nsynthesis,  gas  condensation,  hydrothermal  technique,  homo-\ngeneous  precipitation  and  ﬂux  methods  have  been  investigated\nto  synthesize  nano-sized  cerium  dioxide  powders  [12–18].  The\nsynthesis  of  ultraﬁne  cerium  dioxide  (CeO2)  powders  by\nanhydrous  CeCl3 and  NaOH  powders,  along  with  NaCl  diluent\nvia  mechanochemical  reaction  and  subsequent  calcination  has\nbeen  reported  [19].  Recently,  nanocrystalline  CeO2 samples\nwere  synthesized  by  a  nonaqueous  sol–gel  method  and  their\nsurface  and  interfacial  areas  were  determined  from  nitrogen\nadsorption  [20].  Considerable  effort  has  been  invested  in  order\nto  produce  nano-materials  by  mechanical  milling/alloying\n[21].  This  process  has  emerged  as  a  popular  method  because  of\nthe  possibility  of  producing  large  quantities  of  powders  by\nrepeated  welding, \nre-welding  of  powder\nparticles  subjected  to  high  energy  [22,23].  It  is  difﬁcult  to\nsynthesize  nano-size  CeO2 powders  by  mechanical  milling\nbecause  of  the  tendency  of  nanoparticles  to  form  agglomerates\nduring  milling  [24].  Nevertheless,  some  efforts  have  been\nmade  to  synthesize  nano-sized  CeO2 powder  by  mechanical\nmilling  [25,26].

High-energy  ball  milling  was  found  as  a\nnew  process  for  the  synthesis  of  pure  gadolinium-doped  ceria\nsolid  solution  with  homogenous  microstructure  and  very  ﬁne\nparticles  containing  nanocrystallites  in  the  range  of  (cid:2)50  nm\n[28].\n\nIn  the  present  work  nanocrystalline  cerium  oxide  powder  has\nbeen  synthesized  by  high  energy  ball  milling.  Nano-sized  ceria\nparticles  have  been  produced  after  30  h  milling  of  as-received\ncerium  powders  of  the  micron  size  using  ball  milling  technique.\n\n2.  Experimental  procedures\n\nThe  cerium  (Ce)  powders  from  Alfa  Aesar  with  99.6%\npurity  and  average  particle  size  of  (cid:2)5  mm,  were  used  as  starting\nmaterial.  A  high-energy  attritor  ball  mill  (Szegvori  attritor)  was\nemployed  for  mechanical  ball  milling  (BM)  with  a  ball  to\npowder  ratio  of  40:1.  The  attritor  has  a  cylindrical  stainless  steel\ntank  of  an  inner  diameter  of  13  cm.  The  angular  speed  of  the\nmilling  was  maintained  at  400  rpm  and  the  milling  operation\nwas  conducted  from  10  to  50  h  in  dry  (air  atmosphere)  medium.\nAll  the  milling  experiments  were  performed  under  chilled\nwater-cooling  system.  The  milled  powder  was  characterized  by\nX-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  with  CuKa (l  =  1.5402  A˚ )  radiation\nusing  Philips  1710  X-ray  diffractometer.  Structural  and\nmicrostructural  characterizations  of  mechanically  milled\npowders  were  performed  using  a  FEI:  Technai  20  G2\ntransmission  electron  microscope \n(TEM)  at  200  kV.  The\nelemental  analysis  was  done  using  energy  dispersive  X-ray\n(EDX)  attached  to  a  QUANTA  scanning  electron  microscope\n(SEM)  operating  at  20  kV.\n\nFig.  1.

In  a  single  line  analysis  the  apparent\ncrystallite  size  ‘D’  and  strain  ‘e’  can  be  related  to  Cauchy  (bc)\nand  Gaussian  (bG)  widths  of  the  diffraction  peak  at  the  Bragg\nangle  u;\n\nD  ¼\n\nkl\nbc  cos  u\n\nand\n\ne  ¼\n\nbG\n4  tan  u\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n3.

All  the  peaks  have  been  indexed\nwith  cubic  structure  (ﬂuorite  type)  of  CeO2 with  a  lattice\nparameter  of,  a  =  5.42  A˚ .  The  ﬂuorite  structure  of  cerium  oxide\nwas  not  affected  by  ball  milling.  However,  the  degree  of\ncrystallinity  decreased  at  higher  milling  times  (after  30  h).  The\nXRD  peaks \n(Fig.  1(b–e))  became  broader  after  milling,\nindicating  that  formation  of  nano-sized  CeO2 occurs  as  a\nresult  of  milling  after  20  h.  The  intensities  of  XRD  peaks  were\nobserved  to  decrease  with  milling  time.  However,  no  additional\npeaks  corresponding  to  any  new  phase  were  observed  up  to  50  h\nof  milling  indicating  high  purity  of  the  ﬁnal  products.  After\n50  h  of  milling,  peak  broadening  appeared  in  the  XRD  pattern\nat  around  34-,  which  suggests  amorphous  phase  formation\ntogether  with  nano  CeO2.  The  XRD  pattern  of  20–40  h  of\nmilling \n(1  1  1)\ndiffraction  peak  of  CeO2 phase  is  considerably  broadened\nafter  ball  milling,  suggesting \nthat  nano-crystalline  phase\nappears  as  a  result  of  milling.  The  crystalline  sizes  of  milled\npowders  are \ntime.  The\ncrystalline  size  and  the  lattice  strain  of  the  sample  can  be\n\nto  decrease  with  milling \n\n(Fig.  1(b–d))  clearly \n\nindicates \n\nfound \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\ngiven  as\n\nbc ¼  ða0 þ  a1c  þ  a2c2Þb\n\nbG ¼  ðb0 þ  b1=2ðc  (cid:3)  2=pÞ1=2 þ  b1c  þ  b2c2Þb\n\nwhere  a0,  a1 and  a2 are  Cauchy  constants,  b0,  b1/2,  b1 and  b2 are\nGaussian  constants  and  c  =  2v/b  where  b  is  the  integral\nbreadth  obtained  from  XRD  peak.  The  values  of  Cauchy  and\nGaussian  constant  have  been  taken  from  the  table  of  de  Keijser\net  al.  [30]:  a0 =  2.0207,  a1 =  0.4803,  a2 =  1.7756;  b0 =  0.6420,\nb1/2 =  1.4187,  b1 =  2.2043,  b2 =  1.8706.  From  these,  we  have\ncalculated  the  crystallite  size  D  and  the  lattice  strain  ‘e’  for  the\nmilled  powder.\n\nThe  overall  variation  of  crystallite  size,  lattice  strain  and\nlattice  parameter  with  milling  time  of  CeO2 nano  particle  are\nshown  in  Table  1.  The  lattice  strain  of  CeO2 initially  increases\nup  to  0.80%  after  30  h  of  milling  and  thereafter  decreases  to\n0.52%  after  50  h.  From  this  table  it  is  clear  that  the  crystallite\nsize  of  CeO2 decreases  at  a  faster  rate  during  initial  milling\ntimes  and  then  goes  down  at  a  relatively  slower  rate  to  ﬁnally\nattain  a  size  of  (cid:2)8  nm  during  milling  operation.  It  is  interesting\nto  note  that  the  lattice  parameter  is  also  found  to  increase  during\n\n\fT.P.  Yadav,  O.N.

A  uniform  small  grain  distribution  can  be  seen  in\nthe  dense  microstructure.  Energy  dispersive  X-ray  (EDX)\nanalysis  with  color  mapping  of  30  h  BM  CeO2 has  been  shown\nin  Fig.  3  which  reveals  that  the  contents  are  limited  to  Ce  and\noxygen  only.  It  may  be  noticed  that  no  other  contamination  like\nFe,  Cr  or  N  has  been  detected.  This  could  probably  be  due  to  the\nice  cooled  ball  milling  experiment.  The  color  mapping  of  EDX\nanalysis  shows  homogeneous  distributions  of  Ce  and  oxygen.\nThe  nano-phase  formation  and  milling  effect  was  also\nconﬁrmed  by \ntransmission  electron  microscopy.  Fig.  4(a)\nshows  a  bright-ﬁeld  (BF)  electron  micrograph  of  10  h  BM\nCeO2 powders.  The  grain  sizes  are  found  to  vary  from  (cid:2)150  to\n200  nm.  Fig.  4(b)  shows  a  corresponding  selected  area  electron\ndiffraction  (SAD)  pattern  which  can  be  indexed  based  on  face\ncentered  cubic  (FCC)  phase  (a  =  5.4  A˚ )  along  [0  0  1]  zone  axis.\nThese  features  suggest  the  formation  of  disordered  CeO2 phase,\nwhich  is  in  agreement  with  the  XRD  results.  A  typical  TEM\nmicrograph  of  the  30  h  milled  sample  is  shown  in  Fig.  4(c);\nfrom  this,  the  average  particle  size  of  as-milled  sample  has  been\nestimated  to  be  (cid:2)11  nm.  The  gray  and  white  areas  have  been\nidentiﬁed  as  different  orientations  in  the  nano-CeO2 crystal-\nlites.  The  corresponding  selected  area  electron  diffraction\npattern  is  shown  in  Fig.  4(d),  which  conﬁrms  the  presence  CeO2\nwith  a  sharp  spotty  ring.  The  TEM  micrograph  of  further  milled\n(50  h)  powder  is  shown  in  Fig.  4(e)  and  the  corresponding  SAD\npatterns  in  Fig.  4(f)  are  identiﬁed  to  be  of  the  CeO2 cubic  phase.\nThe  crystallite/grain  size  distribution  has  been  determined  from\n30  h  BM  CeO2 BF  TEM  micrographs,  showing  an  average\ngrain  size  of  (cid:2)11  nm  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.  The  distribution  of\ngrain/crystallite  sizes  determined  by  TEM  was  normalized  to\nunit  area  and  standard  deviation  of  the  size  distributions  is\ncalculated  to  be  (cid:2)3  nm.  The  histograms  of  crystallite  size\ndistribution  shows  a  very  narrow  dispersion  in  the  size  of  CeO2\nobtained  in  the  present  experimental  conditions.\n\nFig.  6  shows  a  high-resolution \n\ntransmission  electron\nmicroscopy  (HRTEM)  image  of  the  30  h  milled  powders  with\nthe  inset  showing  a  Fourier  transform  (FFT)  of  the  image.  The\nHRTEM  clearly  exhibit  a  nanometric  granular  microstructure\nwith  lattice  resolution.  Typically,  grains  are  rounded  with  sizes\nbetween  8  and  12  nm,  and  no  signiﬁcant  through-thickness\nvariations  are  observed.  Careful  inspection  reveals  that  some\ncrystals  are  oriented  along  the  [0  0  1]  direction  indicated  by  an\narrow.  Simple  inspection  of  their  lattice  images  reveals  that  the\ngrains  are  highly  disorientated  from  each  other.  The  lattice\nparameter  is  calculated  by  the  crystallographic  planes  and  it  is\nclose  to  the  lattice  parameter  calculated  by  XRD.  The  HREM\n\n\f5786\n\nT.P.  Yadav,  O.N.

Energy  dispersive  X-ray  spectrum  of  the  30  h  ball  milled  powder,  showing  the  presence  of  the  Ce  and  O  elements  only.\n\nobservation  in  this  study  indicates  that  CeO2 prepared  by  high\nenergy  BM  method  consists  of  small  crystallites  with  different\ncrystallographic  orientations  separated  by  grain  boundaries.\nThe  average  grain  size  obtained  from  measuring  more  than  10\ngrains  was  about  10  nm.  The  HRTEM  image  of  a  typical  area,\nwhich  contains  a  number  of  grains  and  grain  boundaries,  is\nshown  in  Fig.  6.  It  can  be  seen  that  most  of  the  grain  boundaries\nof  CeO2 have  ordered  structures;  however,  the  grain  boundary\nfacets  are  curved  and  coarse  due  to  the  strain  induced  during\nBM.  Lattice  fringes  near  the  grain  boundary  are  somewhat\ndistorted,  which  indicates  the  presence  of  local  strain  in  the\ngrain  boundary  regions.  However,  HRTEM  of  longer  BM\n(50  h)  powder  shows  more  disordered  grain  boundary  regions\nin  Fig.  6(b).  In  other  words,  CeO2 consists  of  a  crystalline\nmatrix  surrounded  by  amorphous \nis  also\nsupported  by  the  Fourier  transform  (inset  of  Fig.  6(b))  taken\nfrom  region  ‘A’.  From \nis\napparent  that  the  amorphous  phases  in  CeO2 nanomaterials\ndepend  on  the  milling  time.  It  can  be  concluded  that,  the  30  h\nBM  can  be  considered  as  best  milling  time  parameter  for  the\nsynthesis  of  CeO2 nano  crystallites  using  the  present  synthesis\nmethod.\n\ntype  phases.  It \n\ninvestigations, \n\nthe  HRTEM \n\nit \n\nThe  experimental  studies  on  the  synthesis  of  nano-sized\nCeO2 using  high-energy  ball  milling  technique  have  been\nreported  [25–28].  The  thermodynamic  driving  force  is  quite\nfavorable  for  CeO2 formation  at  room  temperature  during  BM.\nHowever,  previous  studies  have \ntaken  several  elements/\ncompounds  as  a  precursor  for  the  synthesis  and  the  CeO2\npowders  were  not  homogenous  in  size.  In  our  present  study,  it\nwas  found  that  the  mechanical  milling  of  Ce  in  oxygen  ambient\nresults  in  the  formation  of  CeO2 in  the  initial  stages  of  milling,\n\ntime,  as  shown \n\ni.e.  at  10  h,  and  ﬁnally  a  nano-crystalline  ((cid:2)10  nm)  micro-\nstructure  of  CeO2 is  obtained  after  30  h  of  BM.  However,  in\nfurther  milling  (40  h  and  50  h)  amorphous  layers  around  the\nCeO2 crystallites  have  been  observed.  Therefore,  it  is  clear\nfrom  above  observation  that  the  longer  milling  times  are  not\nfavorable  for  the  synthesis  of  homogenous  nano-crystalline\nCeO2.  It  seems  that  the  grain  reﬁnement  during  the  initial  stages\nof  milling  (up  to  10  h  BM)  is  accompanied  by  oxidation  of  Ce\nwhile  further  milling  results  in  grain  reduction  only.  This  can  be\ninferred  from  the  XRD  proﬁle,  where  the  broadening  as  well  as\nweakening  of  the  XRD  peaks  is  observed  with  the  increasing\nmilling \nin  Fig.  1.  These  results  may  be\nassociated  with  enhanced  dislocation  density  and  CeO2\nformation  in  addition  to  grain  size  reduction.  From  the  X-\nray  diffraction  patterns,  it  is  evident  that  the  formation  of\ndisordered  CeO2 can  be  achieved  by  high  energy  BM  alone.  At\nthe  initial  stage  of  milling,  i.e.  20  h  BM,  the  disordered  CeO2\nphase  contains  large  amount  of  defects  and  grain  boundaries\nresulting  in  considerable  strain.  Therefore  additional  milling\ntreatment \nto  attain  a\nto  allow \nmechanical  and  statistical  equilibrium.  Here  further  milling\nis  sufﬁcient  to  reduce  the  defects  leading  to  strain-relaxation.\nHowever,  small  amounts  of  strain  have  been  observed  in  even\nlonger  milling  periods  as  can  be  seen  in  Table  1.  It  should  be\npointed  out  that  all  the  strain  cannot  be  fully  removed  by\nmechanical  milling  and  post  annealing  alone  as  other\nequilibration  processes  are  critical  steps  to  obtain  strain-free\nnano-phases  [31].  Another  effect  related  to  the  reduced  size  of\nthe  crystallites  as  well  as  oxide  phase  formation  under  our\npresent  experimental  conditions  might  be  due  to  cooling.  The\nwhole  milling  chamber  is  a  chilled  water-cooled  system.  Due  to\n\nis  necessary \n\nthe  system \n\n\fT.P.  Yadav,  O.N.

In  the  nanocrystalline  state,\nsolute  atoms  are  known  to  segregate  to  the  boundaries  forming\na  solute  cloud  in  the  vicinity  of  the  boundaries.  Therefore,  the\nsolid  solubility  in  the  grain  boundaries  may  differ  considerably\nfrom  that  in  the  interior  of  the  crystal.  During  further  milling  in\npresence  of  metastable  CeO2 phase  solid  solution,  nucleation\n\nprocesses  leading  to  stable  single-phase  formation  of  CeO2 may\ntake  place  under  appropriate  thermodynamic  conditions.  We\nwould  also  like  to  point  out  that  due  to  the  formation  of  nano\nsized  Ce  during  the  very  initial  stages  of  milling;  there  is  a\npossibility  of  signiﬁcant  surface  diffusion,  which  would\nenhance  the  oxidation  of  Ce.  However,  it  must  be  emphasized\nthat  there  is  a  need  for  further  study  to  conﬁrm  the  sequence  of\nthe  CeO2 formation  during  high-energy  ball  milling.\n\n\f5788\n\nT.P.
