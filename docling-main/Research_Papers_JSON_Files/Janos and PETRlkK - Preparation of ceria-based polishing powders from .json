PETRlkK \nResearch Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, 400 60  Ost( nad Labem, Czechoslovakia \n\nThe  preparation  of  Ce0v)  oxide-based  polishing  powders  by thermal  decomposition  of \ncarbonates  was studied  and  the  effect  of the  calcination  process conditions  on  the  properties \nof  product  was examined.  High-grade  polishing  powders  can  be  produced  at calcination \ntemperatures  700-1  200~ \nthe  maximum  polishing  efficiency  is achieved  by  calcining  at \n1 000-11 00 ~  The  observed  dependences  were  interpreted  from  the  standpoint  of  the  present \nmechanochemical  theory  of  glass polishing. \n\n1.  I n t r o d u c t i o n  \nPolishing  powders  based  on  cerium  oxide  are  reck- \noned  among  the  most  efficient and  most  widely used \nmeans for polishing glass  1,  2.  As may be  seen from \nthe  designation,  the  active  constituent  of this  type  of \npolishing agents is cerium (IV) oxide but normally non- \nnegligible  amounts  of  oxides  of  the  other  rare  earth \nelements (La203, Nd203,  etc.) may be present as well. \nThe presence of these oxides, however, does not reduce \nthe efficiency of the polishing powders (providing that \nthe  content  of CeO z remains  higher than  about  45% \n-3),  which is due to the formation of ceria-based solid \nsolutions  4. \n\nThe  respective  oxides  are  prepared  by  a  thermal \ndecomposition  of oxalates,  hydroxides  or  carbonates \nof the  rare  earth  elements (REE)  2,  3.  The course  of \nthe calcination process influences in a decisive way the \nproperties  of  a  polishing  agent.  Dependences of  the \npolishing  efficiency (and,  in  sporadic  cases,  of  other \ncharacteristics)  on  the  conditions  of calcination  were \nmeasured during the thermal decomposition of oxala- \ntes  and  hydroxides  of  REE  2,  3,  5  and,  less  fie, \nquently,  of REE  carbonates  6. \n\nIn  addition  to  polishing  efficiency polishing  pow- \nders are characterized by a number of other properties \nsuch as bulk density, granulometric composition, spe- \ncific  surface  area,  pH  of  aqueous  extract,  aqueous \nsuspension  stability,  and  others  2,  3,  7.  Until  re- \ncently  there  has  not  been  established  any  explicit \ncorrelation  among  these  characteristics  (or  other \nphysical  quantities)  and  the  polishing  efficiency of  a \npolishing  powder  except  for  some  rules  formulated \ngenerally  by  Kaller  -8,  9.  One  reason  for  this  situ- \nation  is  the  comparatively  complex  nature  of  the \nprocess  of mechanical  polishing  of glass  that  has  not \nyet been  elucidated  in  detail. \n\nThe  theories  explaining the  mechanism  of the  poli- \nshing  process  may  be  divided  into  three  groups:  (i) \nmicroabrasion  theory,  regarding  polishing  as  con- \ntinuation  of the  process  of grinding on  a  micro-scale; \n(ii) the theory of thermal softening and creeping of the \nsurface of glass; and (iii) chemical theories of polishing. \n\nNowadays  it  may  be  taken  as  proven  that  in  the \ncourse  of glass  polishing  both  physical  and  chemical \nprocesses  are  taking  place. \n\nThe  polishing  efficiency depends  to  a  high  degree \nboth  on  the  dynamic  conditions  during  polishing \n(velocity, pressure)  and on chemical conditions (pH  of \nthe  suspension  of  a  polishing  powder,  presence  of \nchemical  accelerators,  etc.)  10,  11. \n\nIn  the  present  work  we  were  concerned  with  the \npreparation  of  ceria-based  polishing  powders  from \ncarbonate  precursors.  We  studied  the  effect of calcin- \nation  on  the  polishing efficiency and  other  character- \nistics of the polishing agents and attempted to find out \nthe  correlations  among  the  measured  quantities  and \nto interpret them from the standpoint of today's mech- \nano-chemical  theory  of glass  polishing. \n\n2.  Experimental  procedure \n2.1.  Preparation  of  polishing  powders \nThree  series  of polishing  powders  were  prepared: \n\nSeries A:  The  raw material was reagent-grade cerium \n(ni)  nitrate \nSeries  B:  The  raw  material  was  a  cerium-containing \nfraction as  obtained  from a  bastnasite  concentrate by \nextraction  with  tributylphosphate. \nSeries  C:  The  raw  material  was  a  cerium-containing \nfraction as obtained from a  REE concentrate from the \nKola  apatite  by  conventional  processes  -  selective \nprecipitation  and  dissolving. \n\nThe  above  starting  materials  were  used  for  the \npreparation  of nitrate  solutions  at  the  concentration \nof  0.2 m o l d m -  3  of  REE  and  0.1 mol d m -  3  of  free \nnitric  acid.  The  respective  REE  carbonates  were  pre- \ncipitated from these solutions by a  gaseous mixture of \ncarbon  dioxide and  ammonia. The  precipitation  took \nthe procedure has been described in \nplace at  30-35  ~ \ngreater  detail \nThe \nprecipitate  was  separated  by  filtration  and  dried  at \n110~  Thus  prepared  carbonates  did  not  have  an \nexactly  defined  composition,  they  were  a  mixture  of \n\nin  our  previous  paper  12. \n\n4062 \n\n0022-2461/91  $03.00 +  .12 \n\n(cid:14)9  1991 Chapman and Hall  Ltd. \n\n\fnormal,  basic  and  oxo  carbonates.  Using  the  X-ray \ndiffraction  analysis  a  crystal  phase  of  the  Ce20- \n(CO3)z-nH20  type  was  identified.  Besides,  further \nunidentified  crystalline  and  amorphous  components \nwere  present  (see  Fig.  1). \n\nSamples  of  polishing  powders  were  prepared  by \ncalcining the REE  carbonates  in an  open crucible in a \nmuffle  furnace  under  controlled  conditions  (temper- \nature,  time). \n\nChemical  composition  of  the  prepared  polishing \n\npowders  is  given  in  Table  I. \n\n2.2.  Measuring  methods \nThe  polishing  efficiency of polishing  powders  may be \nassessed in  accordance  with  two  aspects:  (a) the  qual- \nity of the  polished  surface of glass,  and  (b) the  rate  at \nwhich  the  mass  of glass  is  being  removed. \n\nThe degree of the glass surface roughness was evalu- \nated  with  the  aid  of  a  microprofile  meter  Hommel \nTester  T-20.  This  instrument,  however,  enables  only \ngreater  unevenesses  to  be measured.

In keeping \nwith  practice,  the  quality  of polishing  was,  therefore, \nevaluated  visually. \n\nThe  rate  of glass  removal  was  assessed gravimetri- \n\ncally in  accordance  with  the  relation \n\nr  =  m/(Sgtppg) \n\n(1) \n\nwhere r is the linear  rate of glass removal, m the loss in \nweight  of  glass  in  the  course  of  polishing,  Sg  the \nsurface area  of polished  glass,  tp the  time  of polishing \nand  9g  the  density  of glass.  The  measurements  were \nconducted  on  a  polishing  machine  K/irger. \n\nThe  particle  size  distribution  was  measured  by  the \nphotosedimentation  method  using  a  centrifugal  par- \nticle  size  analyser  Shimadzu  SA  CP-2.  Based  on  the \nRosin-Rammler-Sperling-Bennet  (RRSB) distribution \nthe  particle  size  characteristic  xa and  grain  size expo- \nnent  n  were calculated.  It  holds \n\nR(x)  =  1 0 0 e x p -  \n\n(x/xd)\"  \n\nR(xa)  =  100/e \n\n(2) \n\n(3) \n\nwhere  e is  the  basis  of natural  logarithms  (2.718) and \nR(x)  is  the  weight  per  cent  of particles  whose  size  is \nequal  or  larger  than  x. \n\nThe value of the apparent  or \"outer\" specific surface \narea  Sv  was  calculated  from  the  RRSB  distribution \ncharacteristics \n\nSv  =  (  kn  ~  Cexp(  x)nx\"-2dx \n\n\\ppxd/  J \n\n(4) \n\nwhere  k  is  the  shape  factor  and  )p  the  density  of the \npolishing  powder. \n\nThe  X-ray  diffraction  measurements  were  carried \nout  on  a  Philips  PW  1140  spectrometer.  The  size  of \ncrystallites  was  calculated  from  the  diffraction  lines \nbroadening  according  to  the  Sherrer  formula  13 \n\na  =  KZ./13cos  0 \n\n(5) \n\nwhere  K  is  the  shape  factor,  X the  wavelength  of the \napplied  radiation,  13 the  broadening  of the  diffraction \nline,  and  0  the  diffraction  angle.  The  procedure  of \nmeasuring  the  cerium  oxide  crystallites  size  is  de- \nscribed  in  a  greater  detail  elsewhere,  for  example,  in \n14. \n\nBesides,  specific  surface  area  Ss  of  the  polishing \npowders  was  measured  by  the  dynamic  sorption \nmethod  with  the  aid  of a  Geotest instrument  (VI~IEK, \nHradec  Krfilov6,  Czechoslovakia). \n\nThe methods of assessing the properties of polishing \npowders  have  been  described  in  more  detail  in  our \nprevious  paper  7. \n\n3.  Results  and  discussion \nThe dependence of the polishing efficiency of polishing \npowders (expressed as linear  rate  of glass removal) on \ntemperature  and time of calcination is shown in Fig.  2. \nIt may be seen that  the effect of calcination  time on the \npolishing  efficiency  is considerably lower than  that  of \npolishing  temperature.  The  dependences  of the  poli- \nshing removal rate  on calcination  temperature  exhibit \n\n4063 \n\n\fPerry  et  al.  17, \n\na  number  of intermediate  products  15,  17,  18.  Ac- \ncording  to  Savin  et  al.  16 \nthe  decomposition  and \noxidation  of  Ce(ut)  carbonates  are  complete  at  the \ntemperature  of  460~ \nhowever, \ndemonstrated  that  Ce(m) was  present even in  samples \ncalcined  at  500 ~  Hence  it  seems  that  preparations \ncalcined  at  temperatures  lower  than  roughly  700~ \ncontain some intermediate products of the decomposi- \ntion  that  have  a  marked  negative  effect  upon  the \npolishing  properties. \n\nHigh-grade  polishing  powders  can  be  prepared  by \ncalcination  a t   700-1200~  More  detailed  measure- \nments were conducted with two series of samples: pure \ncerium(w)  oxide  and  mixtures  of  CeO 2  with  other \nREE  oxides  (content  of CeO2  82%). \nfrom  both \n\nat \n700-1200 ~  enable  to  attain  a  good  quality  of  the \npolished  surface;  the  dependence of the  glass  removal \nrate  on  the  temperature  of  calcination  exhibits  the \nmaximum  at  1050 ~  6. \n\ncalcined \n\nSamples \n\nseries \n\nthe \n\nThe values of the  specific surface area  Ss in  samples \nof the  A  and  C  series  were  measured  by  the  sorption \nmethod;  the  obtained  dependences  (Fig.  4)  are  of \nsimilar  character  as  those  assessed  when  studying  the \nor \nthermal  decomposition  of cerium(m)  oxalate  19 \nhydroxide  16.  Besides,  the  particle  size  distribution \nof the  samples  was  measured  and  the  values  of appar- \nent  specific  surface  area  Sv  were  calculated  from  the \nRRSB  distribution  characteristics.  The  values  of\" S v \nand  Ss differ considerably  and  the  differences cannot \nbe attributed  only to deviations of the real shape of the \nparticles  from  a  spherical  form  as  presumed  in  the \ncalculation  of  Sv.  It  is  necessary  to  assume  that  the \npolishing  agent  particles  have  a  more  complex \nmicroporous  -  character.  The  ratio  Sv/S~  may  be \nregarded  as  a  measure  of compactness  or  mechanical \nresistance of the  particles  20.  The dependence of the \nratio  Sv/Ss  on  temperature  of calcination  is  also  dem- \nonstrated  in  Fig.  4. \n\nThe  sizes  of  the  polishing  agents  crystallites  were \n\nmeasured  by  the  X-ray  diffraction method  (Fig.  5). \n\n60 \n\n~\" 40 '~ \n\nZOp \n\n) \n600 \n\n% \n2(cid:141) \n\n800 \n\n7- (~ \n\n1000 \n\n0 \n1200 \n\nFigure 2  Dependence of polishing efficiency (linear rate of glass \nremoval) on temperature and time of calcination (Series B). \n\nthe  maximum  in  the  temperature  range  of  roughly \n1000-1100 ~  A  steep  decline  in  the  polishing  effici- \nency  begins  when  the  calcination  temperature  de- \ncreases to below 700 ~  and, at  the same  time, also  the \npolished  surface  quality  deteriorates  markedly. \n\nIn  Fig.  3  is  demonstrated  the  dependence  of  the \nremoval  rate  and  glass  surface  roughness  o n   the \ntime  of  calcin- \ncalcination  temperature  (300-800~ \nation  1 h). When  samples  of polishing agents prepared \nat  lower  temperatures  are  used,  not  only  the  removal \nrate  is  low  but  so  is  also  the  quality  of  the  polished \nsurface,  and  this  .is  true  even  in  the  cases  when  the \nglass  was  previously polished  with  some  other,  high- \ngrade  polishing  agent.  Scratches  and,  particularly, \ndefects of the \"orange skin\" type appear on the treated \nsurface,  witnessing  a  chemical  attack  on  the  glass \nsurface. \n\nThe  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  of polishing  agents \nsamples as prepared by the calcination at  300 ~  show \nthat  only cerium(w)  oxide is present.  See Fig.  1 (com- \npare  e.g.  15,  16). \nIt  has  been  known  that  the  de- \ncomposition of Ce(In) carbonates is a complex process \naccompanied by oxidation of cerium and  formation of \n\n3F \n\n0 300 \n\n4.00 \n\n500 \n\n600 \n\n700 \n\n800 0 \n\nr (~ \n\nFigure 3  Dependence of ren~oval rate and roughness of the polished \nglass  surface on  temperature of  calcination (Series B,  time of \ncalcination 1 h).

Time  of calcination  1 h. \n\nThe dependences obtained make it possible to inter- \npret, at  least  qualitatively, the correlation between the \npolishing efficiency (rate of glass  removal) and  temper- \nature  of calcination. \n\nIt  has  been  known  that  both  the  mechanical  and \nchemical  aspects  play  a  role  in  the  polishing  process. \nLet  us  assume  for  simplicity  that  the  overall  rate  of \nremoval r  is a sum of the mechanical (rm) and chemical \n(Q) actions. The contribution of the mechanical  action \nis proportional to mechanical resistance of particles of \nthe  respective  polishing  agent,  i.e.  to  the  Sv/Ss  ratio. \nThe  chemical  contribution  depends  on  the  polishing \nagent  ability  to  create  new,  chemically active surfaces \nin the course of the polishing process. It is, therefore, a \nfunction of the crystal lattice order (size of crystallites, \nnumber  of crystal  lattice  defects).  When  we  calculate \nthe  value  of specific surface  area  Su  according to \n\nSu  =  constant/a \n\n(6) \n\n(where  a  is  the  size  of  crystallites  and  the  constant \nincorporates  the  shape  factor  and  polishing  agent \ndensity),  Su  may  be  considered  specific  surface  area \n\"utilizable\" for polishing and re is then proportional to \nthis  specific surface  area  S~. \n\nThe  dependence  of  r m on  calcination  temperature \nhas a  similar shape as the dependence for Sv/Ss (Fig. 4), \nthe dependence of r~ on  calcination  temperature  has a \nsimilar  character  as  the  curves  1 and  2  in  Fig.  5.  The \ncurves are shown  schematically in  Fig.  6. The shape  of \nthe  cumulative  curve  rm +  r~  corresponds  to  experi- \nmentally ascertained  dependence  Of the  glass  removal \nrate  on  the  temperature  of calcination  (Fig.  2). \n\nBased  on  the  results  of  laboratory  investigations \nconditions for the preparation of polishing powders in \na  pilot  plant  scale  were  specified.  In  spite  of  the  fact \nthat  the  process  of  calcination  was  carried  out  in  a \ndifferent type of equipment  (rotary kiln), good  quality \npolishing  powders  were  produced  whose  properties \ndid  not  differ substantially  from  those  of the  laborat- \nory  samples  as  prepared  in  a  muffle  furnace  (see \nTable  II). \n\n/,>'xx\\ \n\n/ \n\n/ \n/ \n/ \n\n/ /  \n\n\\ \n\n\\ \n\\ \n\nN \\ \n\n\\ \n\nrrn -,, S v S  s \n\nN \n\nN \n\n% \n\nTernpereture \n\nFigure 6  Schematic presentation  of the contributions  of mechanical \n(rm) and  chemical  (re) actions  to  the overall  rate  of glass removal  (r) \n(see  the  text). \n\nT A B   L E I I   Properties  of the  prepared  polishing  powders \n\nProperty \n\nSample  I a \n\nSample  u \n\nBulk  density  (kg m-3) \nParticle  size characteristic  (~am) \nGrain  size exponent \nSpecific  surface  area  S~ (m 2 g- 3) \nLinear  rate  of glass  removal \n\n(ms -1) \n\n403 \n\n475 \n\n7.2 \n1.05 \n2.64 \n1.84  x  10  8 \n\n7.6 \n1.29 \n3.45 \n1.76  x  10-8 \n\n\" Prepared  in  a  laboratory  muffle  furnace  (1050 ~ \n\n1 h). \n\nPrepared  in  a  rotary  kiln  (1050 ~  mean  residence  time  1 h). \n\n4.
